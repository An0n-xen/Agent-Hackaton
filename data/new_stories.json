I&#x27;d love to hear your experiences and advice on the following points:<p>1. Which platforms are best suited for this?\nDo you have recommendations for platforms like eBay, Etsy, Amazon, or niche platforms specifically for dishware and porcelain?<p>2. Any experience in the porcelain market?\nHow can I gain experience and become more knowledgeable?<p>3. How would you approach getting started?\nAny important legal or logistical considerations to keep in mind from the beginning?<p>4. Storage and shipping:\nHow do you manage storing a large amount of dishware to ensure it doesn\u2019t get damaged?\nAny tips for safely and cost-effectively shipping fragile items?<p>5. Experiences and pitfalls:\nWhat mistakes have you made or seen that should be avoided?<p>I know this is not the typical question for this community, but I am always surprised at how broad the knowledge in the HN community is.\nLooking forward to your responses!",

        "text": "The article links to Mozilla\u2019s press release &#x2F; blog entry about the acquisition of Anonym [0]. It\u2019s pretty dystopian reading. The last three paragraphs and the summary of Anonym are more worrying than anything else I\u2019ve read on this so far:<p>&gt; This acquisition marks a significant step in addressing the urgent need for privacy-preserving advertising solutions. By combining Mozilla\u2019s scale and trusted reputation with Anonym\u2019s cutting-edge technology, we can enhance user privacy and advertising effectiveness, leveling the playing field for all stakeholders.<p>I can only interpret this as the urgent need is money. Mozilla has been down this road before. It was not good for them.<p>&gt; Anonym was founded with two core beliefs: First, that people have a fundamental right to privacy in online interactions and second, that digital advertising is critical for the sustainability of free content, services and experiences. Mozilla and Anonym share the belief that advanced technologies can enable relevant and measurable advertising while still preserving user privacy.<p>This is some pretty weak wording for a press release. The economics of the situation are that advertising will always trump privacy. Researchers have successfully de-anonymized anonymised data sets, including medical records. Why would these data be any different?<p>&gt; As we integrate Anonym into the Mozilla family, we are excited about the possibilities this partnership brings. While Anonym will continue to serve its customer base, together, we are poised to lead the industry toward a future where privacy and effective advertising go hand in hand, supporting a free and open internet.<p>Anonym\u2019s customers are advertisers, right? The same people who for decades poured money into eroding that free and open internet that we had\u2026<p>&gt; About Anonym: Anonym was founded in 2022 by former Meta executives Brad Smallwood and Graham Mudd. The company was backed by Griffin Gaming Partners, Norwest Venture Partners, Heracles Capital as well as a number of strategic individual investors.<p>Well, it seems Anonym, Smallwood and Mudd had a nice piece about them written in the Wall Street Journal [1]. From the second paragraph:<p>&gt; Graham Mudd and Brad Smallwood each spent more than a decade building Meta\u2019s advertising system, which allowed the company to offer granular data about how ad campaigns worked with individual users, often by tracking their web and mobile activity.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.mozilla.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;mozilla&#x2F;mozilla-anonym-raising-the-bar-for-privacy-preserving-digital-advertising&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.mozilla.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;mozilla&#x2F;mozilla-anonym-raising-t...</a><p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;17c0f#selection-5751.0-5751.246\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;17c0f#selection-5751.0-5751.246</a>",

        "text": "This honestly comes as a shock. The current government has been eroding rights of its citizens like a clockwork. But this blatant ban on a magazine you were yesterday still able to buy at any store is just brazen. In theory Germany has freedom of press anchored in its constitution (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gesetze-im-internet.de&#x2F;gg&#x2F;art_5.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gesetze-im-internet.de&#x2F;gg&#x2F;art_5.html</a>). This ban uses a trick from the &quot;Vereinsgesetz&quot; - a law that governments the corporate form this magazine uses. The law says that they can be banned if they&#x27;re &quot;against the constitutional order&quot; (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gesetze-im-internet.de&#x2F;vereinsg&#x2F;__3.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gesetze-im-internet.de&#x2F;vereinsg&#x2F;__3.html</a>). Something that is easily produced as the institution in charge of that (the Verfassungsschutz) is under total control of the current government.<p>This will certainly end up in a court of law, but with the increasing pressure on government-critical media is scary. There are still a few neutral websites left that aren&#x27;t blocked (multiple foreign websites are blocked in Germany) or banned but we&#x27;ll see for how long. There is about a year left before the next German general election and it can only be assumed that this powergrab will continue until then.",

Video demo link in url.<p>So, I had an idea for a website where influencers could tokenize their social media clout and sell tokens to their audience where their audience could buy&#x2F;sell or trade them. You know how companies have stocks and IPOs, similarly, I thought of creating a system for Influencers to do the same. But, I had zero coding knowledge and experience. So, I bought the pro version of Claude AI, and after about 200+ prompts and 12 days, I have a fully functioning website with everything from a database, front-end, back-end code, and the only thing missing is the payment gateway as when I tried to get into the depths of it, I could not actually implement a viable solution for something like this as it required a lot of regulatory checks and a lot of upfront investment. This platform is exclusively built for the US audience as where I&#x27;m from, the influencers will never use it until it gets popular in the west. And because of that, I can&#x27;t go through with the payment system because it is extremely complicated and filled with a lot of regulations, fees, and upfront costs.<p>Now, I could not have imagined to create a website like this without the help of Claude AI if had sat down myself and started learning how to do it step-by-step. And to top it off, it would have taken me at least 6 months to do this if I had first learnt how to build websites and then executed on it.<p>If anyone wants to take this platform forward to help me set things up the right way, do reach out as I see it working greatly if it&#x27;s marketed the right way to the right audience. Maybe the right influencers could pick it up and it go become something. Let me know.",

It&#x27;s actually Fedora.<p>In my testing on a similar hardware (also Core M3 and 4gb RAM), Arch-based distros was the best with low RAM. And I tried like, probably 50 distros since last year...<p>Gnome on my HW with Arch, is as fast as KDE, and use less memory than KDE (in theory, I know RAM is a complicated subject).<p>Why fedora is problematic on low end hardware? Because well,  Fedora uses packagekit, which is a ram hog, and this is pretty known. Is not the only reason though, I believe there&#x27;s some other defaults that make it slower than arch on my HW, like zswap vs zram.<p>In my experience with weak CPU and low ram, was that zswap was actually the best choice. On such low RAM like 4gb, you&#x27;ll really need a swap, you can&#x27;t run from this. And zram won&#x27;t be enough, in my experience.<p>Which I guess is one of the reasons why Arch go very well here, as is one of the few distros right now that does a nice default for zswap.<p>With Fedora, and most other distros, I get constant freezes when the RAM is full (which is pretty easy to do with 4gb), and this never happen on arch based distros.",

If you\u2019re just doing a bunch of tutorials you don\u2019t care about, with no way to apply them, it\u2019s hard to stick with it. Any language can teach you the basics and those basics will be transferable to any language.<p>If you want to make a website, start with HTML, CSS, and JS. If you want to make an iPhone app, start with Swift. If you want to make something for Windows, give C# a try. Knowing where you\u2019re heading will narrow things down a lot.<p>While I had a Java and .Net class in college, I never used it after the class, didn\u2019t have a project of my own, and forgot everything. Years later at work, I wanted to automate some stuff I had to do often, which led me to AutoHotKey. That was a painful way to learn, as the syntax and documentation were both difficult to deal with, but because I had a project I cared about, had quick results, and had reasons to keep adding more and improving it, I learned. Eventually I wanted to share some stuff with others and distributing a URL seemed easier than an exe, so I learned basic web dev. Then I needed some server side stuff, so I learned PHP, then needed something else and learned Python, and Ansible, and on and on\u2026 whatever I needed at the time. Was it \u201coptimal\u201d? No, but no path will be. You can only connect the dots looking back. The most important thing to keep moving forward is to have a reason to get excited about it. If you\u2019re in tutorial hell, you\u2019re probably heading in the wrong direction. Things are going to be hard at times. There will be a point where you\u2019ll beat your head against the wall for hours, maybe days, because of a single brace that\u2019s out of place.

        "text": "Python and Javascript are probably the most beginner-friendly general-purpose programming languages to learn (while still being real languages in common professional use).<p>It kinda depends on what you want to do, though (if you know). Python is often used in the sciences and data sciences and ML&#x2F;AI stuff. Javascript powers the Web (among with some desktop apps, unfortunately, but that&#x27;s a different story).<p>Once you know one programming language, it&#x27;s a lot easier to pick up your second, third, nth ones... the syntax of any particular language isn&#x27;t as difficult to pick up as the basic logic systems (booleans, conditionals, loops, etc.) and architectural patterns, etc.<p>If you&#x27;re not sure what you want to do with a career in &quot;programming&quot; just yet, maybe look up some articles or watch YouTube videos about &quot;what does a _________ do?&quot;. Or feel free to discuss it here if you know what you kinda like or don&#x27;t like?<p>Some industries have a &quot;standard&quot; language in common use. If you have some ideas of interests of the types of companies or projects you&#x27;d like to work on, that would help narrow down the choices. Some random examples:<p>* Python is common in science, data science, statistics, sometimes finance, some web dev backends, ML&#x2F;AI, GIS (mapping), robotics, etc. Side note: I recently discovered a fun game that teaches you basic programming with a Python-like language: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=40719279\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=40719279</a><p>* Javascript is essential for web programming, no matter what other languages you use alongside it<p>* Games typically use C++ (especially with Unreal Engine) or C# (for Unity).<p>* Mobile app dev is usually Swift (for Apple stuff) or Java&#x2F;Kotlin (for Android) or React Native&#x2F;Javascript (for cross-platform teams that don&#x27;t want to use platform-native languages)<p>If you have some ideas of things you like or don&#x27;t like, share &#x27;em with us :)<p>------------<p>Check out the StackOverflow annual developer survey to see what programming languages are currently most popular: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;survey.stackoverflow.co&#x2F;2023&#x2F;#section-most-popular-technologies-programming-scripting-and-markup-languages\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;survey.stackoverflow.co&#x2F;2023&#x2F;#section-most-popular-t...</a> (TLDR it&#x27;s Javascript&#x2F;TypeScript, SQL, Python, Java, C#, C++, PHP, and then all the others).",

I&#x27;ve had a wealth of experiences, both good and bad, but few have found their way into my mental models of how the world works, and so I keep making the same mistakes or am unable to effectively navigate my way to a specific goal.<p>From learning new topics &amp; skills, to learning how to network, to learning the dynamics of how an organization and how to navigate various relationships, to making well-reasoned and effective decisions, my mind often feels like mush, totally blinded to the realities of the world. I feel I&#x27;ve been stuck both cognitively and emotionally at a late-teen stage. Poor emotional regulation, difficulties with thinking in nuanced details, constantly flying at 1000 feet.<p>The older I get with no improvement, the more it feels my goals keep drifting farther away. I want to get fit, I want to read more, I want to develop skills, I want to build relationships, I want to be an entrepreneur. These are things many of my colleagues have been working towards for years. It feels like I just wasn&#x27;t given the playbook, and worse, am incapable of piecing one together.<p>Have any of you dealt with this? Any advice?\nAre there coaches that can help?",

Sleep - more than anything else, consistently getting 8+hrs of sleep improves my cognition and consequently my productivity and my mood. I spend a lot of effort on sleep hygiene (dim red light and no screens at night, bright light or sun in the morning), but a couple days of good sleep are irreplaceable.<p>2. Related to 1, cut booze. Mostly because it ruins effective sleep, but also because it\u2019s a depressant and a stand-in for all the other stuff I\u2019m trying to improve for myself. Less booze, better sleep, better mood, better health, repeat.<p>3. Exercise - I can\u2019t do cardio for shit, but I started doing strength training a while back and love it. It\u2019s a great mood booster - physiologically, you\u2019re basically doing a nervous system reset when picking up a sufficiently heavy thing. It also helps me sleep better, reduces a bunch of weird aches and pains, and makes me feel like a badass.<p>Again, go see a professional - my therapist\u2019s how I learned all the above - but in the meantime, those three things have been enormous to improving my mood, capacity, and productivity.",

Can you txt me the list so I don\u2019t forget? I\u2019ll leave it unread to remember to look at it.\u201d<p>I then read it and mark it unread. Over the next hours before I go to the store the little notification icon will bug me and I\u2019ll go to read it only to realize it\u2019s the grocery list. And then mark it unread. When I leave I\u2019ll go to the store and look at the list while I get things. Then I double check the list and my cart before I checkout. Same with people I work with. \u201cSure I can send you that report and you shoot me an email so I don\u2019t forget?\u201d I\u2019ll leave that unread or pinned till I do it.<p>When someone asks me to remind them of something I say \u201cI\u2019d love to but there\u2019s no way I\u2019ll remember to do that.\u201d<p>I use kanban &#x2F; trello to organize my work tasks and make notes immediately because I just accept I won\u2019t remember tomorrow.<p>Once I started doing these things I have way less anxiety about forgetting. I think people rely on remembering stuff way too much. It\u2019s like keeping your money in a pocket with holes in the bottom.<p>Bonus: remember names by making a big deal about it. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d I then use it several times. And when I forget then I just ask them \u201cWhat was your name again?\u201d I say the name that comes to mind when I see them \u201cYour name was John right?\u201d If they say \u201cNo it\u2019s Steve\u201d then I say \u201cAh Steve. I was so close!\u201d And we laugh. Honestly they probably don\u2019t remember my name so this whole schtick helps them too.",

Anybody. It can be family, a friend, anyone. If you already have a therapist, most will be likely happy to do it. All you need is someone to hold you accountable for the stuff you know you need to do. That person will keep tabs on you for a few weeks until you follow all the obvious advice here: find a therapist, a psychiatrist, a gym, quit booze, etc. In worst case scenarios, that person can go ahead and schedule appointments for you.<p>Once you&#x27;re in therapy and|or medication and|or good habits for a couple months, you&#x27;ll get traction to do everything else, and with some luck (finding the right professional, the right drug, the right methods is a trial-and-error) you&#x27;ll build up some momentum quickly and won&#x27;t need anyone keeping tabs anymore.",

Any therapist that just offers vague solutions is leading you on. Do not trust therapists that solely affirm you and never challenge you to change your behavior. <i>Everyone</i> has room for improvement; so it\u2019s not worth paying $100+ a session to learn that you are perfectly fine.<p>B. Remove strong dopamine stimulants from your life (if any) at least for a little while. Dopamine is powerful, but desensitizing. Your brain likes a balance of ups and downs - extreme ups cause everything else to be perceptually lower. This perceived lower outlook often then increases the very need for the thing creating the high, causing a vicious cycle. Alcohol and Porn are the big ones where, anecdotally, you can notice significant changes in your outlook after a month of fully abstaining. Other people may need to cut back or remove Video Games and excess Food for a while. What is important though is that dopamine is dopamine, your brain can get it from many places, so be careful to <i>remove</i> and not <i>replace</i>.<p>C. Consider your spiritual life. I\u2019m personally Catholic, and will always strongly recommend and beg that you begin investigating that (as I\u2019m showing my bias here); but if you are not at peace with God (or even whatever you honor), it will mentally eat at you. Dante\u2019s Inferno may have demons consuming humans in Hell - but the mental anguish from a guilty conscience will eat at you in this life.<p>D. When you know there\u2019s nothing seriously wrong with you (therapy); have your mind mentally balanced (removing strong stimulants); and believe yourself to be in a spiritually good place (no nagging conscience); efforts to exert your will or follow guides to becoming more ordered and focused will, in my opinion, have a much higher likelihood of success as the serious boulders in the road will have been removed.",

        "text": "A neat little corollary to this is to look a little more closely at what temperature actually <i>is</i>. &quot;Temperature&quot; doesn&#x27;t appear too often in the main explanation here, but it&#x27;s all over the &quot;student&#x27;s explanation&quot;. So... what is it?<p>The most useful definition of temperature at the microscopic scale is probably this one:\n    1&#x2F;T = dS &#x2F; dU,\nwhich I&#x27;ve simplified because math notation is hard, and because we&#x27;re not going to need the full baggage here. (The whole thing with the curly-d&#x27;s and the proper conditions imposed is around if you want it.) Okay, so what does <i>that</i> mean? (Let&#x27;s not even think about where I dug it up from.)<p>It&#x27;s actually pretty simple: it says that the inverse of temperature is equal to the change in entropy over the change in energy. That means that temperature is measuring how much the <i>entropy</i> changes when we add or remove <i>energy</i>. And now we start to see why temperature is everywhere in these energy-entropy equations: it&#x27;s the link between them! And we see why two things having the same temperature is so important: <i>no entropy will change</i> if energy flows. Or, in the language of the article, <i>energy would not actually spread out any more</i> if it would flow between objects at the same temperature. So there&#x27;s no flow!<p>The whole 1&#x2F;T bit, aside from being inconvenient to calculate with, also suggests a few opportunities to fuzz-test Nature. What happens at T=0, absolute zero? 1&#x2F;T blows up, so dS&#x2F;dU should blow up too. And indeed it does: at absolute zero, <i>any</i> amount of energy will cause a <i>massive</i> increase in entropy. So we&#x27;re good. What about if T -&gt; infinity, so 1&#x2F;T -&gt; zero? So any additional energy induces no more entropy? Well, that&#x27;s real too: you see this in certain highly-constrained solid-state systems (probably among others), when certain bands fill. And you do indeed observe the weird behavior of &quot;infinite temperature&quot; when dS&#x2F;dU is zero. Can you push further? Yes: dS&#x2F;dU can go <i>negative</i> in those systems, making them &quot;infinitely hot&quot;, so hot they overflow temperature itself and reach &quot;negative temperature&quot; (dS&#x2F;dU &lt; 0 implies absolute T &lt; 0). Entropy actually <i>decreases</i> when you pump energy into these systems!<p>These sorts of systems usually involve population inversions (which might, correctly, make you think of lasers). For a 2-band system, the &quot;absolute zero&quot; state would have the lower band full and the upper band empty. Adding energy lifts some atoms to the upper band. When the upper and lower band are equally full, that&#x27;s maximum entropy: infinite temperature. Add a little more energy and the upper band is now more full than the lower: this is the negative temperature regime. And, finally, when everything&#x27;s in the upper band, that is the exact opposite of absolute zero: the system can absorb no more energy. Its temperature is maximum. What temperature is that? Well, if you look at how we got here and our governing equation, we started at 0, went through normal temperatures +T, reached +infinity, crossed over to -infinity, went through negative temperatures -T, and finally reached... -0. Minus absolute zero!<p>(Suck on that, IEEE-754 signed zero critics?)<p>And all that from our definition of temperature: how much entropy will we get by adding a little energy here?<p>Thermodynamics: it&#x27;ll hurt your head even more than IEEE-754 debugging.",

His comment surprised me, and, in a sense, demonstrated to me that saying a polygraph is &quot;fake&quot; is akin to saying WWE wrestling is &quot;fake&quot;. Of course it <i>is</i>, but that is a misunderstanding that what you&#x27;re watching is a <i>real</i> performance.<p>He said the polygraph itself is just a tool for the interviewer. The real value was in someone who knew how to use the machine to convince the subject that <i>they</i> knew the truth. He continue that in his time he knew some mighty good interviewers who could easily extract anything they needed from you.<p>My father did go the clearance route, and when I asked him about the polygraph he told me he confessed things to the interviewers he would never have told my mother. &quot;Fake&quot; or &quot;real&quot; the polygraph <i>does</i> work in this sense.",

The industry changed and I was able to get out of that business with no debt.<p>Basing any business on platforms like Amazon or Ebay is horrendous.  It&#x27;s nice for a boost, but too many companies get drunk on the easy sales and end up losing everything when they decide one day that you are on their shit list.

        "text": "I&#x27;m still digesting the full paper [1] but it looks like the gist is that when you put all the previously published data together, the timing of megafauna extinction statistically lines up with human arrival better than climate change.<p>The most important pieces of evidence they seem to look at is fungal spores in fossilized poop and sedimentary ancient DNA:<p><i>&gt; Further, other studies show contrasting patterns. For example, a sedimentary ancient DNA (sedaDNA) study from the Yukon shows strong megafauna decline between 21 and 14,500 years ago, prior to the loss of the mammoth steppe biome and the Younger Dryas. In addition, as already mentioned, many extinct megafauna species have last occurrences in the Early or even Middle Holocene, that is, during the relatively stable climate of the Holocene, meaning that a climatic cause for their extinction is unlikely given their previous survival through numerous, massive climatic shifts throughout the Pleistocene, including long and warm interglacial periods.</i><p><i>&gt; An increasing number of studies look at local and regional dynamics in the overall abundance of large herbivores at high spatiotemporal resolution using dung-associated fungal spores. Many of these are able to pinpoint declines to timeframes where the climate was stable, for example, North America ~14\u201313,000 years ago, prior to the Younger Dryas cooling, and 41,000 years ago in Australia at a time of no substantial climate change</i><p>These techniques are still very new and they&#x27;re so sensitive that they should be taken with a grain of salt, sedaDNA especially since it amplifies tiny snippets of DNA found in permafrost. We assume permafrost behaves like an annually laminated sediment but that&#x27;s controversial and archaeology&#x2F;paleontology have had plenty of problems before with DNA snippets and contamination.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cambridge.org&#x2F;core&#x2F;journals&#x2F;cambridge-prisms-extinction&#x2F;article&#x2F;latequaternary-megafauna-extinctions-patterns-causes-ecological-consequences-and-implications-for-ecosystem-management-in-the-anthropocene&#x2F;E885D8C5C90424254C1C75A61DE9D087\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cambridge.org&#x2F;core&#x2F;journals&#x2F;cambridge-prisms-ext...</a>",

Cache those embeddings somewhere. You&#x27;re only embedding simple strings like &quot;name&quot; and &quot;address&quot; - no need to do that work more than once in an entire lifetime of running the tool.<p>2. As suggested here <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=40973028\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=40973028</a> change the design of the tool so instead of doing the work it returns a reusable data structure mapping input keys to output keys, so you only have to run it once and can then use that generated data structure to apply the transformations on large amounts of data in the future.<p>3. Since so many of the keys are going to have predictable names (&quot;name&quot;, &quot;address&quot; etc) you could even pre-calculate embeddings for the 1,000 most common keys across all three embedding providers and ship those as part of the package.<p>Also: in <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rectanglehq&#x2F;Shapeshift&#x2F;blob&#x2F;d954dab2a866c750cd6862d1eb44830b825bcb06&#x2F;index.ts#L57-L64\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rectanglehq&#x2F;Shapeshift&#x2F;blob&#x2F;d954dab2a866c...</a> you&#x27;re using Promise.map() to run multiple embeddings through the OpenAI API at once, which risks tripping their rate-limit. You should be able to pass the text as an array in a single call instead, something like this:<p><pre><code>        const response = await this.openai!.embeddings.create({\n          model: this.embeddingModel,\n          input: texts,\n          encoding_format: &quot;float&quot;,\n        });\n        return response.data.map(item =&gt; item.embedding);\n</code></pre>\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;platform.openai.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;api-reference&#x2F;embeddings&#x2F;create\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;platform.openai.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;api-reference&#x2F;embeddings&#x2F;cr...</a> says input can be a string OR an array - that&#x27;s reflected in the TypeScript library here too: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;openai&#x2F;openai-node&#x2F;blob&#x2F;5873a017f0f2040ef97040a8df19c5b4dc2a66fd&#x2F;src&#x2F;resources&#x2F;embeddings.ts#L80-L90\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;openai&#x2F;openai-node&#x2F;blob&#x2F;5873a017f0f2040ef...</a>",

During the day, I work for a California-based startup, and in the evenings, I enjoy working on side projects[1][2].<p>For the past 3 years, I&#x27;ve been building and iterating on a product I called Horizon Pics, which is a file hosting service, similar to mainstream services, like Imgur. Horizon allows you to quickly upload and store all types of files, from images and video, to PDFs and other documents. The biggest differentiating factor is that Horizon&#x27;s incentives are much more aligned with you, the end-user.<p>Unlike Imgur, Horizon has absolutely no ads, doesn&#x27;t sell your data, has built-in security and privacy controls, and is fully focused on your file sharing needs. No social media or other bloat.<p>This past week, I&#x27;ve launched a rebrand of Horizon which features a brand-new desktop app called Alpine[3], which serves as a local companion to Horizon. With it comes the capability to auto-upload screen captures and upload your clipboards as shareable pastes. For extra privacy, clipboard sharing can be automatically deleted after one view, or end-to-end encrypted with AES-256-GCM client-side. The desktop app is completely free to use! It&#x27;s powered by Tauri using TypeScript, SvelteKit, Sass, and Rust.<p>Horizon offers a free plan with limited storage and upload sizes, while the paid plan offers higher limits.<p>Let me know what you think about the landing page[0]. Does it provide enough information as a new user?<p>[0]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;horizon.pics\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;horizon.pics</a><p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;httpjames.space\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;httpjames.space</a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;httpjamesm\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;httpjamesm</a><p>[3]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;horizon.pics&#x2F;alpine\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;horizon.pics&#x2F;alpine</a>",

Payment processors might get triggered by the fact that adult content is pretty much explicitly allowed. They might also just generally deem you &quot;high risk&quot; and kick you out. I think this is one of the biggest risks you run. For example Stripe, according to their legal docs, prohibit &quot;Cyberlockers, regardless of whether they host adult content&quot;, whatever that means, but it sounds a lot like file sharing in general is a prohibited business.<p>Ever-tightening think-of-the-children laws. You may not want to implement expensive and privacy invasive scanning (note that even local scanning may be privacy invasive[1]), but you might be forced or face a fine. You could always do like Google and budget it in as an expense, love that &quot;fines&quot; line in their reports. This may also be relevant to the previous one, since payment processors might deem you higher risk if you have no scanning.<p>Getting blacklisted for hosting malware. Specifically the support for non-media files. You could end up being blocked by browsers, search engines and whatnot.

As long as the challenge has a verifiable &quot;proof of completion&quot; and a way to identify the credentials, the L402 flow can work with other types of credentials and challenges.<p>2) Micropayments: While L402 supports micropayments, it&#x27;s not limited to them. At Fewsats, we use L402 for subscription-based services with standard SaaS payment amounts, issuing macaroons with 1-month expiration dates.<p>3) Multi-currency support: The Lightning Network currently uses Bitcoin, but with the introduction of Taproot Assets (also from Lightning Labs), it will natively support other currencies like stablecoins (USDt?)<p>4) Open Protocols: The Lightning Network and L402 are open, decentralized protocols that anyone can use and integrate without depending on any specific third party. There&#x27;s no native token, ICO, or controlling company, making comparisons to bankrupt entities irrelevant.<p>5) Network health: The Lightning Network has been operational for years and continues to grow and evolve, with developments like L402 and Taproot Assets enhancing its capabilities and utility I would say it&#x27;s future looks better than ever.<p>If I forgot anything feel free to as me in a comment.",

    "text": "Hi HN!<p>We wanted to introduce our codebase chat that uses a wiki of your repo to do retrieval instead of traditional vector or keyword RAG.<p>We have been pleasantly surprised by the quality of responses. We think creating a language knowledge base for LLMs to do RAG is the future. The way this works is we first write a Wikipedia style article on your codebase complete with diagrams and citations to your code.<p>We\u2019ve run it on some of the most popular repos. If you want us to run in an open source repo please comment below. You can also run it on private repos and the permissions will follow those of the repository on GitHub.\nThe wikis auto update via a GitHub bot and even show you previews of the new wikis in a diff view.<p>Please check it out and let us know your thoughts.<p>Thank you!\nOmar<p>PS Here are some examples:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.mutable.ai&#x2F;hashicorp&#x2F;terraform\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.mutable.ai&#x2F;hashicorp&#x2F;terraform</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.mutable.ai&#x2F;ggerganov&#x2F;llama.cpp\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.mutable.ai&#x2F;ggerganov&#x2F;llama.cpp</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.mutable.ai&#x2F;ethereum&#x2F;go-ethereum\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.mutable.ai&#x2F;ethereum&#x2F;go-ethereum</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.mutable.ai&#x2F;NVIDIA&#x2F;TensorRT\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.mutable.ai&#x2F;NVIDIA&#x2F;TensorRT</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.mutable.ai&#x2F;langchain-ai&#x2F;langchain\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.mutable.ai&#x2F;langchain-ai&#x2F;langchain</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.mutable.ai&#x2F;ollama&#x2F;ollama\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.mutable.ai&#x2F;ollama&#x2F;ollama</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.mutable.ai&#x2F;tensorflow&#x2F;models\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.mutable.ai&#x2F;tensorflow&#x2F;models</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.mutable.ai&#x2F;grafana&#x2F;grafana\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.mutable.ai&#x2F;grafana&#x2F;grafana</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.mutable.ai&#x2F;OpenAutoCoder&#x2F;Agentless\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.mutable.ai&#x2F;OpenAutoCoder&#x2F;Agentless</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.mutable.ai&#x2F;unslothai&#x2F;unsloth\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.mutable.ai&#x2F;unslothai&#x2F;unsloth</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.mutable.ai&#x2F;Dao-AILab&#x2F;flash-attention\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.mutable.ai&#x2F;Dao-AILab&#x2F;flash-attention</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.mutable.ai&#x2F;vercel&#x2F;next.js\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.mutable.ai&#x2F;vercel&#x2F;next.js</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.mutable.ai&#x2F;microsoft&#x2F;vscode\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.mutable.ai&#x2F;microsoft&#x2F;vscode</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.mutable.ai&#x2F;wasm3&#x2F;wasm3\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.mutable.ai&#x2F;wasm3&#x2F;wasm3</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.mutable.ai&#x2F;deepfakes&#x2F;faceswap\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.mutable.ai&#x2F;deepfakes&#x2F;faceswap</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.mutable.ai&#x2F;huggingface&#x2F;transformers\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.mutable.ai&#x2F;huggingface&#x2F;transformers</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.mutable.ai&#x2F;vllm-project&#x2F;vllm\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.mutable.ai&#x2F;vllm-project&#x2F;vllm</a>",

On the one hand, Mercurial&#x27;s command-line UI is so much better thought-through than git&#x27;s that the comparison is ridiculous.  And mercurial doesn&#x27;t have an index, yay!  (Okay, the ability to, on occasion, stage things is useful, but git&#x27;s index usually just serves to confuse, even as someone who is also a long-time git user.)<p>On the other hand, Mercurial&#x27;s model of the world is IMO fundamentally quite a bit worse than git&#x27;s.  Revision _numbers_ are obnoxious and add negative value.  Mercurial&#x27;s concept of branching is just plain wrong.  Mercurial&#x27;s mq extension is spiffy, but it&#x27;s far more tedious to use than git rebase -i.  Stripping mercurial repositories is a bit scary, and it solves a problem that git never had in the first place.",

It is always advertised as more intuitive, and it might be, but the list of &quot;very intuitive verb commands&quot; largely matches git for the most common actions.<p>In addition the different kinds of branches are confusing. Once you understand git branches they&#x27;re simple. Once you understand Mercurial branches you understand just one of the branching models it offers. I believe &quot;bookmarks&quot; are the most similar to git branches, but good luck finding out about them from the website without already knowing they exist.

Once you get past initial impressions and start to do more advanced things, Mercurial sucks. There&#x27;s good reasons why Mercurial fell out of favor.<p>Before anyone tries to say Facebook uses Mercurial, I&#x27;m just gonna point out that their VCS seems to be an entirely different implementation of Mercurial compared to what is available publicly. And even then, the tech lead on that has said recently that they have performance problems to solve. I doubt if they ever will solve those problems because they are inherent to Mercurial&#x27;s implementation. Fixing it would break compatibility with old repos, and take a hell of a lot of work.",

Claude knows how to use vim! And... you can do anything(!) from vim.<p>Turns out, embedding Claude in vim means you get a fully agentic AI pair programmer in &lt;1000 LoC. (See the GitHub README for examples of what &quot;fully agentic&quot; means.) And if you have some semantic vim tools (jedi.vim, eclim, ...) set up, Claude could use them if instructed.<p>Unlike CLIs, you can review Claude&#x27;s changes, and keep the chat history. So an editor interface is the killer feature for real work.<p>Sonnet 3.5 won&#x27;t take your programmer job yet. But it can make you a lot faster, even if you type very fast (especially its one-shot ability is amazing). The trick is not to give up thinking and stay in charge. Just let it do the grunt work.<p>P.S. I literally never wrote anything in vimscript before claude.vim. Thankfully, Claude did 95% of the code grunt work for me, most of the time already self-hosted.<p>P.P.S. Claude is on AWS Bedrock, chances are you can use it even in environments where sending code to random 3rd-party SaaS is a no-no.",

Mozilla wants to frame itself as the browser vendor that cares about privacy, but there are now popular independent browsers like Vivaldi and Orion that go much further than Firefox to protect user privacy, shipping tightly-integrated and fully-featured adblocking out of the box. Firefox on iOS still doesn&#x27;t natively support adblocking, they weirdly segmented that capability out into a separate &quot;Firefox Focus&quot; product.<p>Mozilla becoming an advertising company unquestionably warps their incentives and brings them out of alignment with the end user. Tracking-based internet advertising is inherently adversarial and there&#x27;s no silver bullet or technical approach that magically makes it less so. The fact that their chief partner for this is Meta is deeply disqualifying, given Meta&#x27;s track record (e.g. Onavo scandal, among a multitude of other things).<p>There&#x27;s a ton of real-world value in having Firefox, with a non-Chromium rendering engine, remain relevant in the market. But if Mozilla wants to retain any marketshare at all, they are going to have to compete with other independent browser vendors on UX and privacy. Becoming an advertising company is not the way.",

Fig Pi is a minifigure-sized development board based on the Raspberry Pi RP2040, a built-in LED around back, a 3\u00d73 matrix of RGB addressable LEDs on the front, two buttons; RESET and a BOOT&#x2F;Programmable user button, and an extra 2MB of memory.<p>Connectors on the back give you power, UART, 2-I2C ports and a SPI port.  Important to note these are the JST 1.0 &#x2F; JST SH connectors.  So they fit the Adafruit&#x2F;Sparkfun&#x2F;Pimoroni sets of sensors.  And the USB mini port for programming.<p>I really like the 3x3 matrix, it makes the &quot;blink a led&quot; a little more fun.

Then added color to say if over 85F then dots are red then in ranges (orange, green, purple)  down to less than 40F is blue.

    "text": "I&#x27;ve always wanted to build and sell my own software.<p>But I imagined nasty things like taxes, legal, support, and maintenance coming my way. I would be taken to jail for accidentally violating some esoteric tax regulation. My favorite part was always building, and the employee trade-off of having more constraints and no grown-up responsibilities seemed like a great deal.<p>Not only did it seem like a great deal, it WAS a great deal. Most of my years as a wage-slave have been quite enjoyable. Like Nassim Taleb says, &quot;The three most harmful addictions are heroin, carbohydrates, and a monthly salary.&quot;<p>Running a niche software business in the cloud now requires so ridiculously little overhead that it is almost a rounding error. Most of the taxes, accounting, compliance, payments, servers, networking, databases, and marketing can be automated away if you are willing to pay for it. Take my money!<p>There is another shift, too: generative AI. It now writes most of my code, helps communicate with customers, and even paints pretty pictures. None of the output is of great quality, but the bang for the buck is fantastic. Pouring energy into high-quality artisan output is mostly not necessary. I find that a few things matter a great deal, while most things don\u2019t matter at all.<p>First of all, organizations are absolutely vital. The greatest things in modern life are generated by large organizations. It\u2019s the only way to make a dent in the universe. But a visit to an average-sized meeting of an average-sized company quickly reveals how little actual customer value is being generated on average. In my native language, there is a saying, \u201cjoukossa tyhmyys tiivistyy,\u201d which roughly translates to \u201cthe stupidity of the crowd.\u201d<p>I have news for you, though. If you are willing to be lonely, you will get away with murder! Flying solo is an unfair advantage.<p>A solo operator never attends weekly meetings, asks for a budget, interviews candidates, creates presentations, does code reviews, defines onboarding processes, pitches to investors, fights with co-founders, or books Christmas party venues. When I think about the competitors in my market, I imagine them in a brain-dead meeting, choosing the font size for their next slide, trying to make sense of someone else&#x27;s code, or preparing for their 47th investor pitch. I have the unfair advantage of not doing any of those things.<p>A strong argument for creating value collaboratively is specialization. The marketing person focuses on marketing, the salesperson on sales, and the engineers on engineering. What people forget is that in an average company, the engineer doesn\u2019t actually engineer that much. The bigger the organization, the more time the engineer spends on meetings, Slack, code reviews, interviews, emails, and Christmas parties. When they DO write code, it needs to be polished for collaboration: clean, structured, unit-tested, and according to best practices. Why? Because another engineer will eventually look at it.<p>Now, picture all your potential tasks sorted by priority. Optimally, employee #1 works on the highest priority, employee #2 on the next, and so on down the list. If the top marketing task ranks 263rd, you can bet employee #10, specialized in marketing, is still doing it, no matter what. In a solo operation, you focus only on the most important task. Period. This truly cuts through the bullshit. But how do you know what the most important task is? You don\u2019t really, but that\u2019s a different problem. And who is more equipped to figure it out? Is it the organization where everyone is in their specialized silo or the solo operator doing everything?<p>To be honest, I&#x27;m not really arguing for solo operations. I\u2019m arguing for smaller operations. I believe software products should be built by the absolute minimum number of people possible.<p>Increasingly, as technology advances, that number is one.",

Maybe it was registrars or associated systems letting the engine know. Maybe it was you searching for your new domain. There&#x27;s always a trigger even if you can&#x27;t see it directly, how else would it know about anything? And over the years indicating to the engine&#x2F;spiders that a new site existed depended more and more on site owners to let them know via submissions and console setup etc. The rest of this seems to be personal anecdotes&#x2F;hearsay etc as with many SEO posts. I would think everything is still being indexed, but not <i>shown</i> because of low relevancy, and whatever other things google is trying to do to clean up results (which is fine, not saying that isn&#x27;t happening). Show me the log where no spider ever touched your pages or did and it&#x27;s not showing up before jumping to these conclusions.",

    "text": "Hi, I am Bigyan from The Drive AI. We recently launched Chat Channels and Direct Messaging within The Drive AI.\nThe Problem We&#x27;re Solving: Current systems like Google Drive and OneDrive don\u2019t utilize stored files to create new ones effectively. For instance, if you have a resume and a link to a job description, why can\u2019t Google Docs write a resume for you? Team projects often involve file-specific tasks like reading or writing. However, existing team communication platforms, like Slack, result in inefficient communication due to their long threads of conversation. Have you ever posted in the wrong channel, had to scroll endlessly to find a discussion from a month ago, or faced issues with message locks? Our Solution with The Drive AI: At The Drive AI, we enable you to leverage existing documents to create new ones, ask questions to the AI, and write with AI assistance. Each file stored within The Drive AI has its own chat channel, ensuring that your conversations are always contextual and easily referenced. Additionally, you can send direct messages and create group chats. We are looking for a few teams to test our product. If you\u2019re interested in seeing how we can help your company increase efficiency and team productivity, please reach out to me. Cheers!",

So those and other Nvidia libraries would become part of the API boundary that AMD would need to reimplement and support.<p>Chasing bug-for-bug compatibility is a fool&#x27;s errand.

This does not mean that there will be no new problems introduced, it only eliminates one very narrow class of the problems.<p>A specific example from my experience: few years ago, AWS CloudWatch GetLogEvents switched from returning 10_000 log events per call to returning min(10_000, 1 hour of log events) per call. This did not break API interface at all - after all, the documentation says &quot;limit: The maximum number of log events returned...&quot;, and not a single word mentions a _minimum_ number of log events. This did however kill the performance of my app.. and since this is SAAS I have no way to roll back the code to previous version.",

VCs are only here to maximize returns, if they can have some sort of interesting effect on the world that&#x27;s cool too but returns for their LPs are the sole yardstick. Employees will never get more free time. Remember when word processors and email were going to free up time? All employees will be maximally engaged, plus or minus, and superfluous ones let go. Some jobs might not be successfully replaced, per the customer service example, just like taxi&#x2F;uber drivers won&#x27;t be replaced anytime soon. But as soon as they sustainably can be, they will be. And our government is captured by the financial class, it won&#x27;t matter much which party (in the USA) is in power.",

    "url": "https://github.com/dream3d-ai/torch-submit",
    "text": "After dealing with the pain of distributed pytorch model development &amp; training across multiple companies, I decided to build a quick open source tool that hopefully will be helpful to some of y\u2019all.<p>The Problem<p>Say you have an on-demand GPU cluster from a provider like Lambda labs. Single node GPU training is fairly painless\u2013 just SSH in, provision the node and run your code.<p>However, the moment you go multi-node, things get a bit trickier. Each node has to be provisioned to have the same dependencies and have access to the same code, and then you need some way of submitting and managing the job across all nodes.<p>The simple, painstaking way is to SSH into each node, configure and then run your code with `torchrun`. But, doing this over and over again while trying to rapidly develop is a huge PTA.<p>This is where SLURM or Ray is typically used to manage job submissions. But, setting up SLURM is time consuming and non-trivial (especially when dealing with Infiniband). If you have the cash to reserve a cluster for a year, this is not a problem. But, if you\u2019re running on-demand with clusters of varying size. This quickly becomes painful.<p>Ray tries to solve this but if you\u2019ve ever used it extensively, it\u2019s ridden with bugs and highly sensitive to the underlying resources (shared memory) and host networking.<p>Enter TorchSubmit<p>TorchSubmit is a lightweight job submission &amp; cluster management tool for submitting and managing distributed training jobs.<p>It handles two things:\nSyncing your working directory to all the nodes in your cluster\nExecuting the job across the cluster with `torchrun` properly configured for multi-node (or single-node) distributed training.<p>It allows for rapid development with minimal configuration so you\u2019re spending your time on training instead of dev ops.<p>Under the hood, it uses Fabric to connect to and manage nodes via SSH and `torchrun` to run fault-tolerant distributed training.<p>How to use<p>1. First, provision your cluster with your python dependencies. Personally, I use ansible to do this.\nOn your local machine run, `pip install torch-submit`<p>2. Create a cluster with `torch-submit cluster create`. This will interactively walk you through cluster setup. All you need to do is provide it each node\u2019s public and private IP addresses (optional but recommended for inter-node communication), and the path to your SSH key.\nSubmit your first job with `torch-submit job submit \u2013 python train.py`<p>3. You\u2019ll now see the job running under `torch-submit job list`<p>4. To see the logs from your job `torch-submit job logs \u2013tail &lt;job-id&gt;`<p>Github project: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dream3d-ai&#x2F;torch-submit\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dream3d-ai&#x2F;torch-submit</a><p>Happy training and hope this helps!",

Only the first ~3 layers and last ~3 layers seem &quot;important to not permute&quot;.

    "url": "https://docs.tokenjs.ai/",
    "text": "I&#x27;m excited to introduce Token.js, a free and open source TypeScript SDK that allows you to integrate with over 60 LLMs using OpenAI&#x27;s format, without the need for a proxy server.<p>Features:<p>- Use OpenAI&#x27;s format to call 60+ LLMs from 9 providers (Anthropic, AWS Bedrock, Cohere, Gemini, Mistral, etc).<p>- Supports function calls, JSON outputs, image inputs, streaming, and more.<p>- Runs completely on the client side. No proxy server needed.<p>- Free and open source under the MIT License.<p>We built Token.js because we wanted a simple abstraction to try out a lot of different LLMs without rewriting our code, routing our API calls through a proxy server unnecessarily, or locking ourselves into a single LLM provider.<p>Check out our docs and let us know what you think!<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.tokenjs.ai&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.tokenjs.ai&#x2F;</a>",

Cancer is a very tough disease and sometimes positive results are due to noise in the dataset.<p>- Some studies don&#x27;t consider overall survival (important because you might not die of cancer but you might die sooner from a side effect like Parkinson&#x27;s caused by the treatment). See mammograms and colonoscopies for treatments that look like they are almost entirely ineffective.<p>- Don&#x27;t compare against the standard of care (its easier to show positive results if you aren&#x27;t using the best treatments available)<p>- Allow for self selection (the treatment isn&#x27;t blind or double blind and people drop out of the control group, skewing the results)<p>Imo he&#x27;s an excellent source of the latest data driven results related to cancer and other treatments.",

He highlights issues with re-rendering and the negative impact these had on JavaScript FPS (frames per second). Nick details the solutions they implemented to address these challenges, such as using memoization techniques and stabilizing the data layer to improve performance.

So you&#x27;ll get a &quot;buy it again!&quot; but it&#x27;s fundamentally not the product you purchased.<p>And a company can sell something &quot;good&quot; for a few months, and offer rewards &#x2F; incentives to give good reviews, then use those reviews for the &quot;old&quot; product to sell a revised and &quot;junk&quot; version. Shrinkflation is so real.<p>Companies are free to use Prime to for delivery, but their own processes for returns. &quot;Oh, I have to spend $56 to ship something using DHL over-night now because that&#x27;s the only delivery method the seller accepts for returns? Uh...&quot;<p>Making sure when you see a &quot;Prime&quot; logo, it also means Prime Returns -- like the drop off at Whole Foods style free returns policy.<p>Also... there&#x27;s like no real way to talk to a human when you have a real issue with a seller.<p>Reviews seem... less than honest a lot of the time. Looking at pictures, it&#x27;s often &quot;old&quot; versions of the product at this point. And there are a bunch of settings for reviews, so ratings could be on the &quot;group of products&quot; rather than the specific product you&#x27;re ordering. Like, &quot;Oh this is all tennis shoes we sell, not the shoes you ordered.&quot;<p>Anyway, some simple tools would really help... like giving consumers the ability to filter reviews based on when the reviews were created. &quot;Only show me products with 100 reviews in the last week... then sort by customer review rating.&quot; Or, &quot;For the rating, only count reviews from my country buyers from the last month.&quot; Stuff like that would be easy to do with the data they have, and would help reduce scammer-sellers.<p>Recently I bought a little sensor for my AC system... turns out I didn&#x27;t need it, so I went to return it. I hadn&#x27;t opened it. The seller told me I had literally 3 days to get it back to them... and told me that I had to send it a certain shipping method... and then when I did, they refused to give a refund because they said I had opened the box. For proof, they had opened the box and took a picture of the item open.<p>So I got to pay for the item, and pay $56 shipping, only to not get a refund. Amazon closed the case without ever letting me talk to a human. Shady.",

I hardly think someone making an oil and gas company pay slightly more for a lease is the kind of work we want our legislators to prioritize.<p>Second, it just sounds like the kind of blatant protectionism that&#x27;s often derided around here. If a lease has value to me remaining undeveloped, and it has value to them being developed, then shouldn&#x27;t we be able to compete to see how much the market values those priorities? I think it&#x27;s funny that they&#x27;re afraid of a conservationist billionaire bidding on petroleum leases when there are probably way more petroleum billionaires who could bid if there was any sort of bidding war.<p>Heck, the lease was sold for $19&#x2F;acre, something like $13,000, and the winner complained about the &quot;inflated&quot; price. I can&#x27;t say that I know much about the startup costs for a drilling operation, but is $13,000 really a significant consideration?",

    "url": "",
    "text": "There&#x27;s a thread in the comments for &quot;Fitting an elephant with four non-zero parameters&quot;[0] on whether dark matter is a theory. I&#x27;m posting the question separately hoping for a more methodical deconstruction and understanding of what we mean when reading &quot;dark matter&quot; and its merits&#x2F;evidence.<p>In particular I don&#x27;t like the language used to talk about dark matter where it presupposes its existence (implicitly or explicitly as a particle). Here&#x27;s what NASA says (from a search summary):<p>&gt; Scientists have overwhelming indirect evidence for dark matter. However, its nature remains a mystery. Alternative theoretical explanations for the effects of dark matter, such as modifications to the theory of gravity, don&#x27;t fit with observational evidence.<p>I interpret that to actually be saying that we have evidence for a cause (of gravitational warping of space) not explained by known matter, and the mysterious properties of the hypothetical particle are <i>defined</i> by our observations.<p>However it reads as if we have evidence that the cause of the anomalous observations is caused by a particle that we have yet to discover. What I believe is true in the statement is that we have evidence for &#x27;a cause&#x27; of gravitational warping that&#x27;s not explained by visible matter. This is where I see &#x27;dark matter&#x27; as a placeholder for the cause rather than being a theory. The theory part is the hypothesis that it&#x27;s a particle.<p>In that comment thread there was a link to a video in support of DM[1] but there&#x27;s a later video by the same physicist that says &quot;Dark Matter is not a theory.&quot;[2]<p>What I&#x27;d like to hear are actual arguments&#x2F;evidence for dark matter <i>as a particle</i> and not only as the supposed cause of observations. What constitutes a theory? Is it falsifiable--what predictions does it make? Remember that I mean dark matter as a particle, not merely the placeholder cause of observations.<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=40963179<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;live&#x2F;8rok8E_tz8k<p>[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=PbmJkMhmrVI",

I&#x27;m not sure of the exact arguments, but I believe the evidence available (such as the evolution of galaxies) is only consistent with the existence of <i>actual</i> dark matter particles, and not with some alternative explanation of gravity.<p>It&#x27;s not as simple as saying the mysterious properties of the hypothetical particles are defined solely by our observation, because simply assuming the existence of these massive particles explains <i>all</i> the experimental data within our current framework of gravity, while no other theory has successfully explained the data. We don&#x27;t need to invent any mysterious new properties beyond the properties that we know massive things have.<p>So yes, maybe we will one day discover that dark matter isn&#x27;t real. But by Occam&#x27;s razor, it seems very likely that it&#x27;s real, and nobody has a better idea. If it is the only theory that fits all the data, there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a good reason to reject it.",

To call them complexity or anything else is misleading- transcribing a dictionary by hand into a CSV file is super simple (1 pt) and takes a long time (how many points is 3 FTE-months in your calibration?).<p>Eatimating effort-time vs completion time are quite different, serving different stakeholders. A story that takes 1 point of effort by anyone&#x27;s pointing system could still take a week due to any number of factors (crucial collaborator gets sick, laptop crunched by a car, ransomware attack, whatever). The only really estimable aspect is how long the developer will spend on the work, not when it will be done. Air speed, not ground speed.<p>That said, it&#x27;s not clear how queue analysis helps when you haven&#x27;t spent any time saying how long you might expect each task in the queue to be, or what the dependencies are between tasks within and across teams. Given engaged team members, I&#x27;ve gotten very good results on predicting the pace of progress for sprints, and it all never mattered because everything needed to be shipped. About 4-6 weeks before each X was to be completed we could say with confidence that X would be ready in 4-6 weeks. Not terribly useful.",

It does this on RISC-V, ARM64, and x86_64 alike, and abstracts things so well that you can find a stub kernel in the limine-c-template-portable repository with identical C code providing a kernel that will build for the 3 supported architectures without modification.<p>I&#x27;ve found it nice to be able to work on writing a kernel rather than learning the subtleties of UEFI or the BIOS. Linux is also supported, as well as kernels using the older Multiboot and Multiboot 2 protocols.",

Specifically there should be a news site about startups that has some critical distance from those startups - at least enough that it doesn&#x27;t directly financially benefit from my perception of the companies that it&#x27;s reporting on.<p>Example, by analogy: I&#x27;m interested in news about Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Google, Meta. But I don&#x27;t want to read their PR releases. I want someone to do some filtering on that, because there&#x27;s too much filler there for me to review it daily.<p>This seems to be a really hard thing to do right! There&#x27;s a balance in the reporting that it takes a lot of intelligence and finesse to do right, which is why it seems media co&#x27;s can&#x27;t do it forever.<p>One issue is that it can be too adversarial and too clickbait-y. That is a problem.<p>But the other issue - and this is the problem afflicting the solutions that I&#x27;ve seen - is the opposite. Too far in the pocket of the companies it&#x27;s reporting on, and friendly to the point of sleepiness, like sitting in on all-hands you&#x27;re not being paid to attend. A news site that might as well be called &quot;our venture fund and why the companies we invest in are awesome&quot; isn&#x27;t it.<p>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a site filling this void right now. TC did a decent job at it, for a while, but there should be a new contender.",

As a comic, it&#x27;s shallow and uncreative. There are some diagrams, but these would just as easily have been at home in any other didactic presentation. I think the only benefit the &quot;comic&quot; format gives is that it pressured the authors to be punchy, breaking the material into small chunks that fit into these graphical elements.

        "text": "&gt;Women who make Samsung semiconductors are striking<p>I would say they&#x27;re quite photogenic myself ;)<p>One of the original advantages of semiconductors over vacuum tubes is that they were built to last.<p>Tubes were expected to eventually wear out and be replaced sooner or later, sometimes on a regular basis.  So they came in sockets and many were very easily user-replaceable.<p>Other than that, the equipment was usually built to last for decades.  It would have been the stupidest thing in the world to get a new radio every 5 or 10 years when all it needed was a new tube or two.  And once you had a radio that was satisfying, most people never wanted to buy another radio again.  They most often went forward focused on additional types of long-term technology acquisitions, like TV sets and an automobiles with automatic transmission.<p>Semiconductors made almost all tube equipment obsolete as fast as the expanding variety of devices could be developed, so silicon booms are nothing new.  Corresponding bust cycles must also have been endured by semiconductor companies who have prospered over the decades.<p>The demand for semiconductors is real strong again, especially the more complex and innovative developments.<p>But as time goes by, the demand for the semiconductors needed to produce products having long-term value is not the demand causing the complaints about overwork.<p>It&#x27;s the extreme demand for <i>disposable</i> semiconductors, and the manufactured-for-landfill products that incorporate them, which has been gradually putting more pressure on fabrication workers in the same production facilities where it didn&#x27;t used to be this bad.",

I put extra effort to make sure this looks nice on mobile too.<p>Do I really have to sign up to generate summaries?<p>- I def understand the reservation ppl have about this and am trying to work around it but for now the answer is yes. The main reason is cost control since I&#x27;m using an API to generate the summaries. There are some free summaries at the bottom of home page that you can check out.<p>Appreciate y&#x27;all checking it out!",

Inspired by Perplexity and Phind, I initially aimed to create a specialized search tool. However, as the project evolved, it turned into a general-purpose AI search tool, which seemed easier to implement, lol. \nI&#x27;ve organized and open-sourced the code, which is built with Golang and Remix. I mainly use the long context capabilities of LLM and did not use any RAG. I tested RAG but found that my lack of expertise in this area led to poorer results.<p>I&#x27;d love to hear your feedback!",

    "url": "https://apps.apple.com/us/app/imagine-storiez/id6497486404",
    "text": "Hey guys, this is my first Hacker News post. Happy to be here :)<p>I recently created Imagine Storiez, where players are challenged to make a short story using 5 random words in under a minute. The game is safe to play with kids or at work. The important thing is that I made the first version of the game in just 3 days of coding. Here&#x27;s how:<p>1) Mindset: Every idea can be condensed down into something that can be shipped in 24-72 hours. Even if it\u2019s an extremely simplified version that doesn&#x27;t have the features that the final app will, the core idea can almost always be conveyed using something simpler. [1]\n2) Quantity: This is my 6th app. As I make more and more apps, I can see myself re-using parts of my code, which helps speed up development time. For example, in Imagine Storiez, I re-used a confetti extension I had found before [2], a press-able button animation I use frequently, and certain UI components I had written out from my previous apps. \n3) Research: Before jumping into coding, I took some time to do design research, and I came across some great articles, one of which I used [3], and some of which I didn\u2019t but could help me in the future [4]. \n4) List of goals: After researching, I always lay out a list of EXACTLY what I am going to do for the first version to avoid getting carried away. If I get more ideas while coding, I write them in a separate \u201cIdeas\u201d list for later. For example, I have already taken another 3 days to add a mode with emojis since the first version of the game, and for the update I used the same approach by listing out exactly what I wanted to add so that I can stay focused.<p>My Issue: I plan to add a lot more modes to the app with time, but before doing that I would love to know if the game I made is actually fun. I did test it with family and friends, and we had a great time seeing each other struggle to include all the words in one minute. If anyone would be interested in trying it out and giving me feedback, it would mean the world to me. I would also be more than happy to give away the app for free through promo codes to anyone who asks in the comments.<p>Thank you for reading!

    "url": "https://github.com/iesahin/xvc",
    "text": "Xvc is a data and files management tool on top of Git. It allows you to track large and numerous data files next to your code and notebooks. You can also configure remote storages in S3 and compatible services (like Minio, DO Spaces, R2, Wasabi) or Rsync connections over SSH. You can send, receive and share these data files selectively. You can create signed URLs on S3-compatible services for your files that are valid for a limited time.<p>Xvc can also run your pipelines defined by steps (stages) that can be invalidated by various kinds of dependencies, like files, globs, URLs or regexes. If you have a directory with thousands of files that you preprocess and only one of these changes, you can define a command to run only for the changed file (or changed lines in a CSV file). It runs these steps in parallel if there are no dependencies between each other.<p>It can be used for general software development as well. You can keep non-code artifacts along with the code and define dependencies. It can be used for deployment via Git. It&#x27;s small enough to be used on CI. All features can be used from Python and Jupyter notebooks. User docs are in [3] and development docs are in [4].<p>Python bindings and example usage are in [2].<p>You can install for CLI with `cargo install xvc` and for Python with `pip install xvc`.<p>Data management features are similar to DVC, git-annex, and Git LFS, but Xvc doesn&#x27;t depend on Git directly. It runs the git commands on your behalf but this can be disabled and if needs arise and popularize, another VCS can be used. Pipeline features are similar to DVC&#x27;s but have more granularity and flexibility.<p>I experimented with ECS at the core of software. Modeling the software using entities and components attached to them is, in my experience, much more productive, flexible and maintainable than OOP. There is a state machine to run multiple possibly interdependent processes in the pipeline. I had to write a directory walker with gitignore, a file watcher to track file metadata at the OS level when a pipeline is running and even experiment with documenting the software with dialogues between hare and tortoise.<p>The larger experiment was, of course, whether I could do this. It&#x27;s an ambitious project but it&#x27;s my daily habit now and development in Rust feels nice. I feel as if I&#x27;m meeting with my friend in the morning.<p>I started Xvc as a solo project after leaving my work on DVC&#x27;s technical docs. (See [5] for a brief history. See [6] for similarities and differences from it.)<p>I still don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s ready for prime time yet but this is HN and I wanted to share. My inner voice says &#x27;you shouldn&#x27;t release before writing all those Python tests&#x27; but I told him it&#x27;s my birthday and it&#x27;s nice to release something on your birthday.<p>I&#x27;m open to any feedback, questions, and suggestions. I added boxes for feedback and questions to the docs. I don&#x27;t accept any non-trivial code contributions at the moment. I may change the license to a more &quot;business-friendly&quot; one partially (for just xvc-ecs or xvc-walker crates, for example) and don&#x27;t want to feel bad about it. In any case, it will be free and open for human individuals and it doesn&#x27;t track anything about you. I don&#x27;t even track the number of visitors or downloads. I only know when someone stars the repo.<p>I plan to add more features, like experiment tracking, adding annotations to binary files and using these in file operations, and a server to manage your data repositories and maybe a GUI for all these. I don&#x27;t intend to pollute my priorities by trying to build a business around it. My priority is development, writing, and keeping my fellow hackers happy.<p>Cheers from Istanbul.<p>[0]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xvc.dev\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xvc.dev</a>\n[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;iesahin&#x2F;xvc\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;iesahin&#x2F;xvc</a>\n[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;iesahin&#x2F;xvc.py\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;iesahin&#x2F;xvc.py</a>\n[3]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.xvc.dev\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.xvc.dev</a>\n[4]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.rs&#x2F;xvc\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.rs&#x2F;xvc</a>\n[5]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;emresahin.net&#x2F;a-brief-history-of-xvc&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;emresahin.net&#x2F;a-brief-history-of-xvc&#x2F;</a>\n[6]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.xvc.dev&#x2F;start&#x2F;from-dvc\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.xvc.dev&#x2F;start&#x2F;from-dvc</a>",

        "text": "So many products make email verification optional in order to improve their funnel. But it&#x27;s a huge security risk, because it leads to bugs like this. Very few engineers and PMs will actually stop to think: &quot;Wait, what if the user&#x27;s email address isn&#x27;t verified?&quot;<p>I kind of wish we could just pass a law that says you have to validate email addresses before attaching them to accounts at all. Because otherwise, competitive pressure will keep pushing people towards not doing it and aiming this gun at their foot in the name of conversions.<p>In the absence of a law: If your service insists on allowing unverified email addresses, you should store them in a completely different place in your database from verified ones. Maybe even obfuscate them with some encoding. Do whatever you can to make it really hard for anyone to accidentally rely on an unverified address. Ideally make it impossible for anyone except the team in charge of authentication to even see an unverified address.<p>On another note, holy shit. So many people (myself included) chose Google Domains specifically because they thought it would be secure and trustworthy, because it&#x27;s Google. Won&#x27;t make that mistake again.",

        "text": "&gt; Taylor Monahan, lead product manager at Metamask, said Squarespace never accounted for the possibility that a threat actor might sign up for an account using an email associated with a recently-migrated domain before the legitimate email holder created the account themselves.<p>&gt; \u201cThus nothing actually stops them from trying to login with an email,\u201d Monahan told KrebsOnSecurity. \u201cAnd since there\u2019s no password on the account, it just shoots them to the \u2018create password for your new account\u2019 flow. And since the account is half-initialized on the backend, they now have access to the domain in question.\u201d<p>This sounds like gross security negligence, and should probably be considered a crime when you&#x27;re at the size of Squarespace with (assuming) a dedicated security team. Hopefully executives&#x2F;management can be held responsible for whatever damage was done because of this.",

While a Mac would suit my needs today, which is mostly coding, media, browsing Internet, I wonder what are other things I could be using it for in the future but are worse, or completely missing (perhaps some hard to bypass system limitations come to mind).

In a lot of ways it feels like linux on a slick piece of hardware with good commercial support.<p>Coming from linux I miss the freedom though. That maybe sounds kinda stilted or melodramatic or something but I don&#x27;t mean anything ideological. I just mean it annoyed me, for example, to find out that a stock market app was installed and I couldn&#x27;t just get rid of it easily. I looked into it but it involved a whole series of things that I decided just wasn&#x27;t worth it. But it&#x27;s still there. Is it a big deal? No, but then again why should I not be able to remove a stocks app?<p>I also miss KDE which has been my favorite GUI of everything I&#x27;ve used.<p>Basically I just miss being able to take things off I don&#x27;t want there, and put on things I do. Seems like something simple to me.<p>I don&#x27;t regret buying my Mac and would do it again. I sort of feel like a good combination is Mac on laptop and linux on a desktop&#x2F;workstation&#x2F;server. But if for some reason Asahi went away I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d buy another Mac. I haven&#x27;t used Asahi linux, but it&#x27;s like an insurance or canary or test case or something. It&#x27;s this thing in the back of my mind that doesn&#x27;t really affect me day to day but is always there.<p>When I was thinking about linux laptops, I was leaning toward an HP developer laptop or Framework, or Starlabs I think? I mention it only because I&#x27;m not sure if your XPS experiences would transfer always.<p>If it makes a difference, I continue to use linux in various capacities, especially for work, so I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s gone away entirely in my life. I might feel differently or stronger or something if I wasn&#x27;t using linux at all anymore.",
