This is why there is an emerging trend of companies [which ones?] building partnerships with telecoms to power use cases across multiple industries from competitor intelligence, alternate credit scoring, hyper-targeted marketing and more.<p>... Yet, despite the importance of telecommunications for society and in connecting industries, network operators are not yet fully embracing the value of the data they have at their fingertips&quot;</i><p>But the value of this data (90% former customers) was clearly not to the telco itself... so who is the unnamed partnership and who is the end-customer?

Yet this didn&#x27;t happen for Ticketmaster or MOVEit breaches revealed around the same time. &quot;Cybersecurity delay period requests&quot; is a new power quietly authorized by the DOJ+SEC+FBI, 18 Dec 2023 [0]. Note that [1] emphasizes this as &quot;Corporate Alert - guidance for delay requests [on SEC 8-K]&quot;. Might Congress already have known&#x2F;suspected, when it authorized the cybersecurity delay request powers, of the Snowflake&#x2F;AT&amp;T breach? Either way, whoever is involved seems to have very powerful friends. Also, the big FISA renewal vote was Apr 19 2024 [2].<p>- Seems the cloud instance was set up the same time GPT-4 was released (March 2023), also when Snowflake set up a Telco business unit [3] <i>(&quot;Location data... Alternate credit scoring, hyper-targeted marketing and more... an emerging trend of companies building partnerships with telecoms to power use cases across multiple industries&quot;)</i>. This product is not aimed at the telcos&#x27; use-cases, but at new revenue streams. (Who might the unnamed Snowflake AI partner(s) be?)<p>- They set up the Snowflake instance with AT&amp;T&#x2F;MVNO customers with timestamps removed, but with location data, yet the phone numbers not obscured or removed. Doesn&#x27;t sound like &quot;internal analytics&quot; or &quot;competitor analysis&quot;. What sorts of end-users want to pay for the entire social-graph of 110m, regardless whether those customers never make a phone call again? [EDIT: I confused the details of this AT&amp;T breach with the other (2019) one disclosed on 3&#x2F;2024: 77m AT&amp;T&#x2F;MVNO customers, 90% of them former customers]<p>[0]: &quot;FBI Guidance to Victims of Cyber Incidents\non SEC Reporting Requirements: FBI Policy Notice Summary&quot; <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fbi.gov&#x2F;investigate&#x2F;cyber&#x2F;fbi-guidance-to-victims-of-cyber-incidents-on-sec-reporting-requirements-fbi-policy-notice-summary\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fbi.gov&#x2F;investigate&#x2F;cyber&#x2F;fbi-guidance-to-victim...</a><p>[1]: &quot;US Corporate Alert - DOJ, FBI, and SEC provide guidance for delay requests relating to disclosure of cybersecurity incidents under form 8-K&quot;\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.klgates.com&#x2F;DOJ-FBI-and-SEC-Provide-Guidance-for-Delay-Requests-Relating-to-Disclosure-of-Cybersecurity-Incidents-Under-Form-8-K-1-2-2024\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.klgates.com&#x2F;DOJ-FBI-and-SEC-Provide-Guidance-for...</a><p>[2]: US House approves FISA renewal \u2013 warrantless surveillance and all\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=40041784\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=40041784</a><p>[3]: Snowflake cloud Telco unit, 4&#x2F;2023: &quot;Unlocking the Value of Telecom Data: Why It\u2019s Time to Act&quot; <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.snowflake.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;telecom-data-partnerships&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.snowflake.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;telecom-data-partnerships&#x2F;</a>",

        "text": "As someone with a hardware background, I&#x27;ll throw in my $0.02. The schematic capture elements to connect up large blocks of HDL with a ton of I&#x2F;O going everywhere are one of the few applications of visual programming that I like. Once you get past defining the block behaviors in HDL, instantiation can become tedious and error-prone in text, since the tools all kinda suck with very little hinting or argument checking, and the modules can and regularly do have dozens of I&#x2F;O arguments. Instead, it&#x27;s often very easy to map the module inputs to schematic-level wires, particularly in situations where large buses can be combined into single fat lines, I&#x2F;O types can be visually distinguished, etc. IDE keyboard shortcuts also make these signals easy to follow and trace as they pass through hierarchical organization of blocks, all the way down to transistor-level implementations in many cases.<p>I&#x27;ve also always had an admiration for the Falstad circuit simulation tool[0], as the only SPICE-like simulator that visually depicts magnitude of voltages and currents during simulation (and not just on graphs). I reach for it once in a while when I need to do something a bit bigger than I can trivially fit in my head, but not so complex that I feel compelled to fight a more powerful but significantly shittier to work with IDE to extract an answer.<p>Schematics work really well for capturing information that&#x27;s independent of time, like physical connections or common simple functions (summers, comparators, etc). Diagrams with time included sacrifice a dimension to show sequential progress, which is fine for things that have very little changing state attached or where query&#x2F;response is highly predictable. Sometimes, animation helps restore the lost dimension for systems with time-evolution. But beyond trivial things that fit on an A4 sheet, I&#x27;d rather represent time-evolution of system state with timing diagrams. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s many analogous situations in typical programming applications that call for timing diagrams, but they are absolutely foundational for digital logic applications and low-level hardware drivers.<p>[0]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.falstad.com&#x2F;circuit&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.falstad.com&#x2F;circuit&#x2F;</a>",

Visualizations do exactly that.<p>This is especially important in the age of AI coding tools and how coding is moving from lower level to higher level expression (with greater levels of ambiguity). One ideal use of AI coding tools would be to be on the lookout for ambiguities and outliers and draw the developer&#x27;s attention to them with relevant visualizations.<p>&gt; do you know exactly how your data is laid out in memory? Bad memory layouts are one of the biggest contributors to poor performance.<p>In this example from the article, if the developer indicates they need to improve performance or the AI evaluates the code and thinks its suboptimal, it could bring up a memory layout diagram to help the developer work through the problem.<p>&gt; Another very cool example is in the documentation for Signal&#x27;s Double Rachet algorithm. These diagrams track what Alice and Bob need at each step of the protocol to encrypt and decrypt the next message. The protocol is complicated enough for me to think that the diagrams are the source of truth of the protocol<p>This is the next step in visualizations: moving logic from raw code to expressions within the various visualizations. But we can only get there bottom-up, solving one particular problem, one method of visualization at a time. Past visual code efforts have all been top-down universal programming systems, which cannot look at things in all the different ways necessary to handle complexity.",

But there is quite some issues on it on the technical side too:<p>- Any sufficiently advanced program has non-planar dataflow graph. Yes &quot;pipelines&quot; are fine, but anything beyond that - you are going to need labels. And with labels it becomes just like plain old non-visual program, just less structured.<p>- Code formatting becomes much more important and much harder to do. With textual program representation it is more or less trivial to do auto-formatting (and the code is somewhat readable ever with no formatting at all). Yet we still don&#x27;t have a reliable way to layout a non-trivial graph so that it doesn&#x27;t look like a spagetti bowl.

        "text": "I think people get too hung up on the visuals. There was a (failed) attempt to create something called intentional programming by Charles Simonyi. That happened in the middle of the model driven architecture craziness about 20 years ago.<p>In short, his ideas was to build a language where higher level primitives are created by doing transformations on lower level syntax trees. All the way down to assembly code. The idea would be that you would define languages in terms of how they manipulate existing syntax trees. Kind of a neat concept. And well suited to visual programming as well.<p>Weather you build that syntax tree by typing code in an editor or by manipulating things in a visual tool is beside the point. It all boils down to syntax trees.<p>Of course that never happened and MDA also fizzled out along with all the UML meta programming stuff. Meta programming itself is of course an old idea (e.g. Lisp) and still lives on in things like Ruby and a few other things.<p>But more useful in modern times is how refactoring IDEs work: they build syntax trees of your code and then transform them, hopefully without making the code invalid. Like a compiler, an IDE needs an internal representation of your code as a syntax tree in order to do these things. You only get so far with regular expressions and trying to rename things. But lately, compiler builders are catching onto the notion that good tools and good compilers need to share some logic. That too is an old idea (Smalltalk and IBM&#x27;s Visual Age). But it&#x27;s being re-discoverd in e.g. the Rust community and of course Kotlin is trying to get better as well (being developed by Jetbrains and all).<p>But beyond that, the idea seems a bit stuck. Too bad because I like the notion of programs being manipulated by programs. Which is what refactoring does. And which is what AI also needs to learn to do to become truly useful for programming.",

        "text": "This article seems focused on &quot;how do we help programmers via visual programming&quot;, and it presents that case very well, in the form of various important and useful ways to use visual presentation to help understand code.<p>There&#x27;s a different problem, of helping non-programmers glue things together without writing code. I&#x27;ve seen many of <i>those</i> systems fail, too, for different reasons.<p>Some of them fail because they try to do too much: they make every possible operation representable visually, and the result makes even non-programmers think that writing code would be easier. The system shown in the first diagram in the article is a great example of that.<p>Conversely, some of them fail because they try to do too little: they&#x27;re not capable enough to do most of the things people want them to do, and they&#x27;re not extensible, so once you hit a wall you can go no further. For instance, the original Lego Mindstorms graphical environment had very limited capabilities and no way to extend it; it was designed for kids who wanted to build and do <i>extremely rudimentary</i> programming, and if you wanted to do anything even mildly complex in programming, you ended up doing more work to work around its limitations.<p>I would propose that there are a few key properties desirable for visual programming mechanisms, as well as other kinds of very-high-level programming mechanisms, such as DSLs:<p>1) Present a simplified view of the world that focuses on common needs rather than every possible need. Not every program has to be writable using <i>purely</i> the visual&#x2F;high-level mechanism; see (3).<p>2) Be translatable to some underlying programming model, but not necessarily universally translatable <i>back</i> (because of (1)).<p>3) Provide extension mechanisms where you can create a &quot;block&quot; or equivalent from some lines of code in the underlying model and still glue it into the visual model. The combination of (2) and (3) creates a smooth on-ramp for users to go from using the simplified model to creating and extending the model, or working in the underlying system directly.<p>One example of a high-level model that fits this: the shell command-line and shell scripts. It&#x27;s generally higher-level than writing the underlying code that implements the individual commands, it&#x27;s not intended to be universal, and you can always create new blocks for use in it. That&#x27;s a model that has been <i>wildly</i> successful.",

In this GUI you can select your code recipe, a simple code step, for example here is a recipe to list files in the directory <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mljar.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;python-list-files-in-directory&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mljar.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;python-list-files-in-directory&#x2F;</a> - you fill the UI and the code is generated. You can execute code cells in the top to bottom manner. In this approach you can click Python code. If you can&#x27;t find UI with recipe, then you can ask AI assistant (running Llama3 with Ollama) or write custom python code.

The problem can be pushed away by zooming, by maybe an order of magnitude, but for a long living project growing in size and complexity, it will not be enough.<p>2. In text, near everything is just a grep (fzf,...) away. With the power of regex, if needed. Do the no-code folks nowadays implement a equally powerful search functionality? I had very bad experience with this.<p>3. Debugging: although the limited possibilities of plugging graphical items together is like an enhanced strict type safety, I&#x27;m sure that errors somehow happen. How is the debugging implemented in the visual tools?<p>4. To store&#x2F;restore the visual model, the tool developer needs to develop a binary&#x2F;textual&#x2F;SQL&#x2F;... representation and unique source of truth for it. I think the step from that to a good textual DSL is smaller than to a GUI. And the user can more or less effortless use all the powerful tools already developed for shells, IDEs, editors, ....<p>So in my opinion most of the visual programming things are wasted time and wasted effort.",

All this stuff can be greatly simplified with a restrictive UI which simultaneously does the job and prevents people from shooting themselves in the foot.<p>You need to weed out unnecessary complexity; give people exactly the right amount of rope to achieve a certain set of possible goals, but not enough rope for them to hang themselves.<p>I&#x27;ve been working towards this with <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;saasufy.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;saasufy.com&#x2F;</a><p>I&#x27;ve chosen to focus on CRUD apps.

I do agree with it, while I&#x27;d add this conclusion (personal opinion):<p>- Usefulness of visualizing the codebase, interconnections, memory layouts - all of these are attempts of an overview of the things that aren&#x27;t immediately clear. It&#x27;s an attempt for an outside-of-the-box view, which becomes necessary in larger codebases&#x2F;environments&#x2F;companies. This is very useful for, say, an architect of a system (or systems), and even for individual contributors that are not comfortable in the current view (they may be struggling, or they may achieve better performance, of either the app or themselves with the insight gained from these visualizations).<p>- Actual visual programming only offers &quot;boxes&quot; of functionality and makes you frame everything the way it was initially imagined. It&#x27;s limiting expressiveness and makes your mental model adopt the framework&#x27;s way of thinking. Everyone I know has abandoned any visual programming only because they feel it is limiting them (&quot;It&#x27;s a nice toy, but it&#x27;s too difficult for me to create something more complex&quot; is a common thing I hear).",

        "text": "&quot;Programming&quot; is just giving a computer instructions. Visual programming is therefore just giving a computer instructions using a visual medium.<p>Instructions for a computer can be quite simple or quite complex. There are many ways we have to represent these instructions with text, but we also all recognize that most programs are far too complex to represent in text that a person can keep in their brain all at once.<p>If a person believes they remember how a program works because they read its source code in text form, they&#x27;re actually mistaken. Their brain is actually tricking them: it has read lines of code, and created abstract representations of groups of those lines, and it&#x27;s the collections of the abstract representations that form &quot;the program&quot; in their brain. Nobody thinks about a program as &quot;line 27 operation 3&quot;. They think of that one module, with that one function, that has one in-put and two out-puts, that does a certain thingy in the middle of it, etc.<p>This is true for every single aspect of a computer (hardware or software). The fact that people have imagination is the only reason anyone understands how a program works.<p>With text programming, you&#x27;re slowly &quot;crafting&quot; the abstract representation, one line (or concept) at a time. A graphical interface for source code is the inverse: you&#x27;re creating the abstract representations first and connecting them together, and the computer generates the lines&#x2F;concepts to make it work.<p>This article is discussing different ways of representing that process, but the general concept is identical no matter how you use it. You come up with abstract concepts and connect them. The specific ways in which you do that, how you visualize it, what kind of concepts, at what layers, etc, is certainly useful, but not really the point. The point is to be able to get your ideas down as abstracts and let the computer figure out the nitty gritty details.<p>Why do that instead of with text? Because pictures let you explore many concepts in many ways without needing to keep them all in your head or look for references. The picture keeps everything &quot;in memory&quot; (on screen) so your brain doesn&#x27;t have to keep all the concepts in your short term memory, and you don&#x27;t have to think about unnecessary details. It&#x27;s a brain hack: the picture is a buffer for your imagination.",

What changes all the time (and what made the swimlane and machine diagrams relevant) is the business logic. This is the part that continues to evolve, that is badly communicated or incompletely specified most of the time, and that is the part most in need of increased visibility.<p>In my experience, this relates closely to what&#x27;s really important in software development -- important to those who pay the software developers, not to the developers themselves.<p>I&#x27;ve seen lots of architecture diagrams that focus on the pieces of technology -- a service here, a data bucket there, etc etc. I think that reflects the technical person&#x27;s affinity for and focus on tools and building blocks, but it puts the primary motivations second. To me, the key drivers are the &quot;business&quot; needs - why do we need the software to do the things, who will use it, and how.<p>In my work, I try to diagram the workflows -- the initial inputs, the final product, and the sequence of tasks (each with some intermediate ins and outs) in between, noting which roles &#x2F; user personas execute them. A kind of high-level UML diagram with both structural and behavioural elements. I find that it raises key questions very early on, and makes it easier to then continue laying down layers of increasing technical detail.<p>If I were to design a visual language, this is where I would start - formalizing and giving structure to the key concerns that motivate and inform software design, architecture and development.",

That leaves us with code generation from the diagrams, or more accurately from the languages describing the diagrams, or creating diagrams from code. For understanding a code base it is the later that you want, you do not want visual programming but code base visualization. There are tools for this - for example NDepend [1] for .NET - but they are not really what you want, they are not capable of abstracting enough, summarizing a million lines of code in a handful good diagrams is a very difficult task, for humans as well as for machines.<p>The other way around - code from diagrams - also does not really work. Those diagrams are domain specific languages in disguise, build to concisely express a very specific programming task. This was tried in the 90s under the label of model-driven programming, you just draw all kinds of diagrams which probably meant that under the hood you were producing XML documents, those could then be fed into code generators and you are done without the need for any real coding. But as we all know, once you step beyond the complexity of hello world, essentially nothing fits any model perfectly, there is always this weird edge case or completely nonsensical requirement. And now you start messing with your code generators or wrapping the generated code in another layer to get the edge cases adjusted.

Honestly, if you think about it that way, text based workloads are going to win every time because the keyboard is much more precise and fast than a mouse. My point is that this will always be an interface device problem, not a visual vs text (mouse vs keyboard) problem.

One is a result from the other. Both sometimes are not written down but exists in team-members heads. Both are used for communication. Both should be in sync.<p>If an analyst can create the &quot;perfect functionality model&quot; than a developer can parse this into the &quot;perfect software&quot;, provided he created the &quot;perfect architecture model&quot; to assist this.  See my other post on MDA and MBSE.<p>When developing (parts of) complex software, I always liked doing something akin to &quot;Unit Testing&quot; (plus a custom UI&#x2F;report) that basically checked the boxes of a Architecture-Model I wanted to adhere to. With near-instant compilation (or hot-reloading) it becomes easier to see a live reflection of the data going through your pipeline live.<p>A good End-To-End (E2E) test can do the same for a Feature-Model, e.g. using Test Driven Development (TDD) or any derative of this. However todays tooling is still behind on this, compared to tooling developers have for architecture. Only a few solutions exist and those are tech-giant level (IBM) or contained and highly specialized for one business sector &#x2F; problem domain.",

Here DataViz can bridge the legibility gap between the internal representation and something a programmer can quickly grasp to find bugs.<p>So in my opinion the best place for going beyond text in programming is by adding custom DataViz to express program state at runtime.",

        "text": "When something needed does not evolve, it helps to understand why, and address that.<p>Yes, visualizing the expected programming model helps with programming.  Tech leads should convey the programming model somehow, and graphics can help.  The highest-traffic use is onboarding people, but because that&#x27;s rare (we hope), there&#x27;s little investment in optimizing that, and it doesn&#x27;t happen.<p>Yes, it would be nice to have live views of the system, so we can see if the actual system is what we expect.  That&#x27;s hard enough that it&#x27;s only done for high-traffic operational issues (typically after they bite, hard).<p>But that hints at the real issue.<p>The question is really about decision support for code&#x2F;design issues, graphical or otherwise.<p>And like all decision-support questions with non-trivial domains, what&#x27;s needed depends primarily on what you&#x27;re trying to decide, not the domain.  So there&#x27;s no one or even few diagrams that will support all decisions for a given code base or operational behavior.  Performance tools show hot spots, not logic errors. However, knowing it&#x27;s about decisions, you can start to enumerate stakeholders and use-cases, looking for common or critical features as the high-value targets.<p>Yes, the domain makes for different results, e.g., for react+js vs elixir.  (I&#x27;d argue that the bulk of the benefit from type&#x2F;memory-safe languages and devops comes from the issue they foreclose -- the degrees of freedom and risk they remove.)<p>But if you&#x27;re trying to track some programming model, you end up needing recognizable&#x2F;literate code, i.e., metadata for whatever your time slice (design, prototype, analysis, compile, runtime, first-failure data capture, historical trends...).  And since the various levels of compilation&#x2F;assembly often efface the original model, that problem becomes not only system-wide but stack-deep. It sounds intractable in the general case.<p>In my experience one quick strategy provides most of the benefit: an easy stakeholder-driven interface for experiments.<p>That means things like a REPL for language, code navigation, a generated REST API web page, tests, Go&#x27;s quick performance test wrapper, a full-text search of the live model, span&#x2F;tracing displays, etc.  Reducing the cost of asking questions is the best thing you can do to support decisions of whatever type.<p>When people have different perspectives on the proverbial elephant, I wouldn&#x27;t start by arguing how to draw different models but by adding more people&#x2F;perspectives.  Once the sources stabilize, then you can integrate them, so you&#x27;ll want to make sure there are common touchpoints in each that make integration possible.",

        "text": "&gt; But why do people keep coming back to visual programming?<p>Because real programming languages are free.<p>That&#x27;s it. That&#x27;s the main reason. Sure, there are hobby projects, yes, but almost every visual &quot;programming language&quot; in use in the industry, is a proprietary product, being licensed or sold. It&#x27;s a way to make money, and a pretty smart one to be honest: Once people invest time, resources, training, and build actual stuff in my proprietary system, they either invest a lot more money to get rid of it, or keep using it. And inertia in businesses being what it is, they usually chose the latter. What better vendor lock-in than a programming language?<p>-----<p>IMHO, no, we don&#x27;t need &quot;visual programming&quot;. I have worked with several such systems in professional settings. There is one thing they all have in common: They suck. No exceptions. It doesn&#x27;t matter what level they abstract at. They are all sold on the simplest of use cases, and to be fair: They can manage them very well. And some even look pretty and are a pleasure to work with.<p>At the start, that is.<p>Then the honeymoon is over, and you hit the first snag. The first thing the devs of it didn&#x27;t anticipate, or anticipated but implemented badly. And you build around that. And then the next thing happens. And then next. And the next.<p>And very soon, you keep running for the escape-hatch constantly, like calling into library code, or making HTTP requests to some server to do things that would have been a breeze in a real programming language. Congratulations, we are right back to &quot;non-visual-programming&quot;, only now our real code is tangled up in this mess, having to waste precious clock cycles pandering to the ideosyncracies of a less capable system, for no better reason that to not get rid of said system. And god help you if you have more than one of these things having to talk to each other. Now you can write glue-code between to pseudo-programming systems! FUN!<p>And, of course, these things are usually not accessible to any established tooling: There either is no version control at all or some vendors pet project idea of what a cool (read: bad) git alternative should look like. There usually is no way to unit- or integration-test anything. The only &quot;IDE&quot; that can deal with them, is the one the vendor provides. Also, `grep`, what&#x27;s that? Never heard of it.<p><i>&quot;But why do people keep coming back to visual programming?&quot;</i><p>Allow me to ask an alternative question: Why do people stick with textual programming, despite decades spent on trying to make visual programming happen?",

        "text": "Visual programming isn&#x27;t a programming paradigm - it&#x27;s just a way of representing code.   The underlying paradigm is the important thing.   It should be decided upon first, and only then should the representation be chosen.<p>In my opinion, the only paradigm that visual programming makes sense for is dataflow.   Unfortunately, although there were dataflow hardware research projects in the UK, USA, and Japan several decades ago which resulted in prototypes, there are no hardware datafiow machines (MIMD - multiple instruction, multiple data) today. In these, there would be multiple general purpose processors.   Whenever a processor receives all its inputs, it executes an instruction, and sends its outputs to other processors.   There is no flow of control, and the order of independent operations isn&#x27;t determined until run time.   So programs, at the lowest level, are directed graphs.   The advantage of dataflow is that it maximizes concurrent operations.<p>The few commercially successful visual dataflow languages (e.g. Prograph, LabVIEW) aren&#x27;t pure dataflow.   The way they handle conditionals and loops breaks the paradigm.   In any case, they run on conventional hardware, instead of dataflow hardware, real or simulated.   If you design your dataflow language to run on a MIMD dataflow machine, your language would be very different and, in particular, you&#x27;ll need a way to handle conditionals and loops, which can no longer be control structures, to fit the paradigm.<p>There are a few languages which stand out as having been particularly well designed for their paradigm - Lisp (particularly the Scheme branch), Prolog, APL, and Smalltalk.   All are about as simple as they can be - &quot;Il semble que la perfection soit atteinte non quand il n&#x27;y a plus rien \u00e0 ajouter, mais quand il n&#x27;y a plus rien \u00e0 retrancher.&quot;   This can and should be done for dataflow, where programs are directed graphs.   You can either do this as a visual language with data flowing along edges between vertices, or textually.   A visual representation seems more natural, and there&#x27;s only one right way to do it.   With text, you have less than satisfactory choices.<p>You&#x27;re not choosing a visual representation because it&#x27;s easier for non-programmers or anything like that.   The decision is imposed on you by the paradigm.   If you&#x27;re dead set against visual programming, you effectively rule out dataflow programming.<p>Are there any advantages in dataflow programming if the underlying hardware doesn&#x27;t support MIMD?   I have found several: it permits a certain amount of liveness; it makes type inference more straightforward, as the types at each end of edges must match, and type checking can now be done in the editor; function and type definitions, as well as data, can be represented and manipulated as labelled directed graphs, and stored as the textual representation of graphs; and functions can be compiled by the functions themselves, by running them without executing the vertices.<p>Some of you might remember I&#x27;ve been working on my own dataflow language (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fmjlang.co.uk&#x2F;fmj&#x2F;tutorials&#x2F;TOC.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fmjlang.co.uk&#x2F;fmj&#x2F;tutorials&#x2F;TOC.html</a>, <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fmjlang.co.uk&#x2F;fmj&#x2F;interpreter.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fmjlang.co.uk&#x2F;fmj&#x2F;interpreter.pdf</a>).   At present I&#x27;m improving how the type inference works, and making the language fully homoiconic (programs are stored in the same data structure as other directed graph data structures).   This involve a major rewrite of large parts of the code base, which will end up smaller and easier to maintain.",

        "text": "Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) that follow the IEC 61131-3 standard [0] utilize 5 different programming languages, three of which are visual&#x2F;graphical, and two of which are text-based.<p>The graphical languages are well-suited to industrial programming contexts - and especially object-oriented modalities - as nearly everything that is being programmed is a representation of something in the physical world.<p>Plants have process lines which have equipment types (classes) with different variations (inheritance) which have sensors which have various configuration parameters and so on. Many of these types of equipment have common functionality or requests made of them (interfaces).<p>One of the IEC text-based languages - Instruction List (IL) - is deprecated, the while other - Structured Text (ST) - is Pascal-based, great for more complex math and logic functions, and likely runs a significant portion of the infrastructure you interact with on a daily basis. This is especially true if you live outside of North America, which tends to still rely heavily on ladder logic.<p>The three graphical languages have somewhat different ideal use cases and functionality, though for historical reasons ladder logic is frequently used to do 100% of the work when other languages may perhaps be more appropriate. The same may be said of some 100% structured text implementations.<p>Ladder logic (LD) was designed to represent banks of physical relay logic hardware. It is read left to right, and if a connection exists between the two, the right side is active. As such, it is great for simple controls that rely on boolean logic and simple functional logic. A good ladder program can be seen and understood and debugged quickly by anyone who has any knowledge of the underlying physical system, which makes it very popular for basic on&#x2F;off systems such as motors or pumps.<p>Function Block Diagrams (FBD) are exactly what the name implies, and like LD are read and processed left-to-right. I like them for certain kinds of math processing such as linear interpolations.<p>Sequential Function Chart (SFC) is, like FBD, exactly what it sounds like. These are ideal for describing state machines with a defined start and end point, and discrete steps in between. They are not expressly limited to a single active state at any one time, and can have multiple parallel active branches. Codesys-based systems extend on the base IEC specification by expanding upon the way that actions and transitions can be defined and worked with.<p>Codesys-based systems also have Continuous Function Chart (CFC) and Unified Modeling Language (UML) languages. CFC may be thought of as an extension of FBD and&#x2F;or SFC, and is useful for creating higher-level equipment coordination diagrams and designs. UML has class and state diagrams, and I&#x27;ve used it not at all, so I won&#x27;t comment on it further.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;IEC_61131-3\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;IEC_61131-3</a>",

        "text": "One thing to consider for visual programming is whether you are describing data flow or control flow.<p>Most of the examples where visual programming is working well are either for data flow: shader&#x2F;material graphs in game engines, compositing and other node based editors in various video,3d,vfx software. Other examples of case where visual programming is used audio software and industrial automation logic - it&#x27;s similar although here it describes more of continuously evaluated process that all happens at the same time, with some parts potentially being evaluated at different rates instead of simply evaluating whole thing in a loop.<p>All that is more similar to functional programming. Describing control flow, implies imperative programming. You have to ask why are imperative programming languages more popular than functional ones? I don&#x27;t have a good answer to this part. The same reason might also be at fault why visual programming isn&#x27;t more popular, assuming visual programming is better for functional programming.<p>But why is visual programming bad for describing control flow? It&#x27;s not like we don&#x27;t have standard way for doing that. Flow chart style diagrams, is one of the basic tools used when teaching programming.\nI guess one of the factors might be goto vs structured programing. ~50 years ago programmers realized that arbitrary jumps across the code makes a mess, and it is beneficial to restrict the control flow to few specific patterns. Flow chart style visual programming is more or less goto spaghetti. A disciplined programmer could restrict themselves to the patterns that match with structured programming, but the same could be said about using goto in text based programming languages. Reality shows that unless they are forced, relying on individuals being always disciplined (or knowing what the best practices) doesn&#x27;t go very well. It&#x27;s more effective to have a first class support for the preferred structures, and remove or strongly discourage unstructured tools (even though in theory they are more powerful).<p>With that said structured visual programming isn&#x27;t impossible. Scratch is somewhat that, but it also shows why at that point it becomes somewhat pointless. You more or less get your usual imperative text program but with additional blocks drawn around. Closer to structured code editing(completely separate concept from structured programming) of text based language than visual programming.\nThere is still bit of hope. All the examples for DRAKON language I have seen, looked mostly structured. Not sure how it&#x27;s enforced. It does have first class loop structures, but supposedly branching based loops like in the flowcharts are also possible.<p>Most recommendations for best practices will encourage programmers to limit the control flow complexity within a function, as having too many nested loops and branching will still make the code hard to understand. This makes me wonder about cause and effect. Do we limit the control flow complexity because text based languages are bad at expressing it, or do we use text based languages as a tool to restrict complexity (which is always bad). Or is it just a coincidence that we can use text based languages, because the amount of local complexity that we can comfortably work with fits the limits of text based languages.<p>One more thought is that the text based programming isn&#x27;t exactly purely text based.  We don&#x27;t perceive the code as stream of characters, like the computer does.Remove all whitespaces including newlines and it will become nearly impossibly to work with code beyond few expressions. Elements like line indentation and syntax highlighting rely on human visual pattern recognition. So maybe there is a way for more visual manipulation even for languages that strongly resemble our current text based programming languages.",

Think things like Rail Signaling, Burner Management Systems, Aircraft Landing Gear Hydraulic Sequencing, complex machinery automation and interlocking, to name a very few examples. It can also extend to Cyber Security and transactional systems like banking etc.<p>In my tool I haven&#x27;t quite got to automatic translation to TLA+, yet, and maybe I personally won&#x27;t, because as discussed in the blog and some of it&#x27;s links, the interface itself prompts a certain level of thinking that is highly beneficial. So I have done everything but an automatic translation to TLA+, but I can see no reason it is not possible, I already automatically translate the specification into controller code.<p>But the key point arising from the definition of state based behavior, which is what TLA+ is all about, is that implicit state is the enemy. And if all states and transitions are not defined explicitly, then the door is opened to implicit state.<p>The often-quoted example is the Apple Facetime bug where you could follow a specific, unintended, sequence to make a call and then listen to a callees microphone before they answered.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@DavidKPiano&#x2F;the-facetime-bug-and-the-dangers-of-implicit-state-machines-a5f0f61bdaa2\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@DavidKPiano&#x2F;the-facetime-bug-and-the-dan...</a><p>Also interesting is this one where a bug involving implicit state was fixed by changing two characters, after som eeffort.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.scottlogic.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;08&#x2F;finite-state-machines.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.scottlogic.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;08&#x2F;finite-state-machines...</a><p>For finite state machines the problem is the State Chart (and or UML) - neither forces an exhaustive and unambiguous examination of every transition for every state.<p>In order to do this, you need a State Table, and ideally a dereferencing of the inputs by grouping them into Transition Input Conditions from raw inputs.<p>The State Table looks like columns with all possible &quot;From&quot; states heading them and the &quot;To&quot; state underneath. Where more than one possible &quot;To&quot; state is possible, a new column is created with the same &quot;From&quot; state.<p>The logic is &quot;scanned&quot; or &quot;polled&quot; at regular intervals, it generally cannot be event driven, to ensure deterministic outcomes are easily known, because the precedence for a state that might solve two different transitions at the same time is established by left to right on the table as the table is scanned (could be right to left, but it needs to be defined and repeatable).<p>Try being totally deterministic in your specification with a chart or UML, you end up having to assign order of execution numbers to each state bubble as a minimum, and it is hard to make intuitively clear the exact behavior that will emerge in edge cases.<p>But, straight away any impossible state transitions are explicitly excluded and all possible transitions are easily read off the first two rows<p>The state columns are crossed with rows of transition conditions, which are logic conditions derived from raw inputs. Every square for a transition possibility for any state must have an entry, even if just an X to indicate not allowed or don&#x27;t care.<p>Not only that, every possible transition has a unique square (with grid reference if you want) which you can attach a design or user comment to for explaining the reasoning for the selected transition, or for generating an alarm for that transition condition. So even a square with an X might get a comment to explain why that transition was elected not to be valid.<p>Outputs are driven as a feature of state, as a Moore machine is better intuitively, even though you likely end up with more states. Often the state explosion is vastly improved with hierarchal state machines, the first thing to do is split out modes and states, often giving great improvement.<p>You then have the basis for an exhaustive and unambiguous definition of a state machine with no implicit state. It can be an executable specification, the tool I have created allows single stepping thru the &quot;scans&quot; of the logic, and generates things like state trace logs etc for debugging while designing.<p>If you want to specify known state based behavior with no implicit state, this is by far the best available practice, only improved by a further examination by formal methods (TLA+ or similar) of the resulting specification. UML won&#x27;t get you here, and no methodology of state charts I have seen or can imagine can get to the same place in a comprehendible way.<p>But, I find the process that the designer is forced to use to create the state machine&#x2F;s in tabular form like this yields immense improvements over traditional specification methods, which usually focus almost exclusively on expected behavior only and are in the form of the &quot;crappy narrative&quot;.<p>Because the target is industrial safety and control systems I put an OPC server in so the logic could be simulated and hook up to a HMI to test user interaction, if desired.<p>Final point is the tabular form then also leads to an extremely compact and succinct algorithm for solving that reduces the logic required to handful of bitwise logic operations. Given the maxim that errors are proportional to LOC, this means the chances of errors can be substantially reduced over any other state machine implementation I have seen, by orders of magnitude, something highly desirable for a functional safety implementation.<p>I have spent years on this and development of the tool, for my own use at this stage. But I am very confident there is no better practice (yet I still wait for the world to beat a path to my door), and it starts with the correct interface to describe the specification, and flows naturally from there. There are hints of similar approaches, some around for a long time, but nothing I have seen that condenses all the dimensions into one 2D table like this and allows it to be executable in it&#x27;s own format.<p>It is a little involved to explain, often needing a couple of hours of hours of focused attention. But once people see it and get it, they usually don&#x27;t want to work any other way.<p>But I have found a significant portion of my colleagues, who are experienced engineers, just aren&#x27;t able to grasp the full extents of what it means, why and how to use it or that it can be used to describe fully arbitrary behaviors - first clue is if they do not believe that such a simple basis can describe all wanted behaviors and&#x2F;or they ask why they have to use the table and why not a chart or UML. UML is just not going to get you there, this way will.<p>There is a lot more, but I would be surprised if many people have read this far.<p>But I take my chance to explain the surprising benefits of a particular UI&#x2F;interface in solving a particular problem and how it flows on. If anyone is genuinely interested feel free to DM me, as I said I have a tool I made in PyQt to enable this workflow. It has been used on design of some large industrial safety systems, some projects with overall value in excess of $1B, but lends itself to any state based behavior.",

You begin to have confidence in your mental model, recovering the time you used to spend going over the same nodes again and again in a haphazard way. In distributed systems in particular, the work is often detailed, manual, error prone and high latency - with a solid mental model you can get through a checklist of steps with minimum difficulty and high confidence that you didn&#x27;t miss anything.

Mine has (for now) the following sections: Morning checklist, Todo, Done, and Meeting Notes.<p>The morning checklist consists of things like checking email, checking Teams, skimming the team&#x27;s handover queue, logging into various things, etc.<p>Todo is a stack of things I can&#x2F;should tackle. Most important ones to the top. I limit it to 15 items, no matter what. But realistically, I typically only interact with about the top 5 99% of the time.<p>Done gets wiped every morning and I add things to it as I do them. Things like, &quot;emailed Joe Schmo for 3rd time to ask for ETA&quot;, or &quot;helped Fred troubleshoot the frobnitz.&quot; Little things that I would totally forget about but cumulatively end up taking a huge chunk of the day. I&#x27;ve never had a boss that expressed a concern, but I think of it as my primary defense if anyone accuses me of slacking off all day. (Maybe it&#x27;s just to convince myself...)<p>Each meeting I go to gets its own section for the day. If the content was important enough to save into my second brain[1], I clean it up and transfer it over there at the end of the day, or the beginning of the next day at worst.<p>Any complex investigation or rabbit hole gets its own section as well. It&#x27;s astonishingly difficult for me to actually reason about any complex system or design without writing it out and actually describing it to myself. I envy those who can just &quot;see&quot; it all at once in their mind&#x27;s eye.

He will have nothing but the tools which may help him in doing his work, but of these he has a large assortment, and all in the most perfect order. It is a mistake to think that that little room has elastic walls and can distend to any extent.

If I need to context switch and do something right now, fine, now interrupt B is the top of the stack, and when it\u2019s done, I go back to shaving yak number A1(a). If I\u2019m blocked, I pull the front task in my priority queue and push that to the stack. If the stack gets too deep with unrelated tasks and interrupts, I usually pull it apart and put everything into a priority queue.<p>At a higher level of granularity it also helps to record what you\u2019ve actually done for performance reviews and the like.",

        "text": "The best tool for this I&#x27;ve found so far is Logseq [0]. The only things that come close in functionality are some really custom Emacs roll-your-own things that were just too hard for me as a basic Doom Emacs defaults user, and Anytype. However, I couldn&#x27;t understand the storage of Anytype enough to convince me that my work would be okay with it (e.g. encryption, but IPFS-ing your files all over the place, maybe?).<p>Anyway, here are the reasons to consider Logseq for a &quot;lab journal&quot;. Note all of these features are unique to Logseq (except the ones I note, afaik), but the subset of them are from what I can tell:<p>1. Local storage: this is just messing around with markdown on a local file. You can keep it in your corporate storage as a regular folder, at home, it is completely separate from your data sync setup and you can choose what you want. They are working a new database-backed version of the files for faster querying (though I have &gt;10k files in it now and it does fine).<p>2. Open source: Obsidian, a popular alternative, is not open source. Considering this carries confidential info and all my personal stuff (not at work though!), I gotta trust my tools.<p>3. <i>Killer feature that only Logseq has</i>: custom, datalog query engine to query your existing notes and aggregate things. Other tools have some similar thing, but it&#x27;s mostly akin to &quot;search&quot; and possibly ANDing some terms together, but Logseq has much more advanced uses enabled by this engine.<p>The datalog and querying feel initially like a &quot;draw the rest of the owl&quot; meme, as it is up to you to decide whether you want to create namespace hierarchies (e.g. should your `vim` page be `devtools&#x2F;vim`, just `vim`, or tagged with `devtools`?), but once you figure out a system, it takes a bit to craft a few clever queries and reuse them with templates.<p>I have a reasonably slick system for this, where I have a set of queries prioritized by due date &#x2F; priority on my home page, along with incoming (waiting for someone) and outgoing (someone waiting on me) dependencies. I organize things with a series of &quot;project&quot; pages that each have a very long query to aggregate all my daily journal entries (and other pages) that are tagged with anything related to that project page (e.g. I have a page `CMake Template Repository` where I&#x27;m trying to create a github template repo for C++ projects so I don&#x27;t have to write it from scratch each time). It has really helped me get things done despite having a bit of ADHD. If there&#x27;s enough interest, I can try to write this up in a blog post.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;logseq.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;logseq.com&#x2F;</a>",

        "text": "I have been using PlainTasks [0] plugin with Sublime Text for many years now at work to do something similar. It is sort of a mix between GTD [1] and journalling.<p>I create a new file monthly (since that is the &quot;sprint&quot; duration at work) and for each project I am working on, I create a project heading and a list of tasks below each. The plugin doesn&#x27;t enforce any schema and is just a plain text file so I can iterate on the task list, record thoughts as free form notes anywhere (just below the project heading or below a particular task or just in the file anywhere.<p>If the notes grow too large for a particular project (they don&#x27;t usually for me), I pull them in a separate file dedicated to that project.<p>I iterate on the task list as things become more clear. For eg. I might start as &quot;Find out how to deploy new certificates on our cluster nodes&quot;. Once I have done some research or talked to my colleagues, I might mark this a done or delete it and replace it with a list of steps required to deploy the certificates.<p>I also mark things I am going to do today with &quot;@today&quot; every day in the morning. If something planned comes up urgently, it gets it own task with &quot;@critical&quot; tag. The plugin highlights these tags for me.<p>There are some more features but I only use creating and marking tasks as done with the 2 tags. The plugin is also semi-abandoned which is a big +1 for me as I don&#x27;t have to worry about flow breaking changes or sudden sponsorship messages or constant updates.<p>I don&#x27;t use sublime for anything else but tracking tasks and notes so it gives me a sort of dedicated workspace for collecting my tasks. Recall is just a plain text search away. I have been using this for many years and has been extremely effective for me. Whenever I feel lost of overwhelmed, I just look this file, find the @today tags and suddenly I am back in my flow.<p>Most of the other tools I have tried (Jira, Asana, Trello, Github&#x2F;Gitlab issues, Azure DevOps, company internal project management tooling etc.) are too opinionated, not flexible enough, sends unnecessary notifications to me or everyone on the team and are a chore to maintain (busywork).<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aziz&#x2F;PlainTasks\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aziz&#x2F;PlainTasks</a>\n[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gettingthingsdone.com&#x2F;what-is-gtd&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gettingthingsdone.com&#x2F;what-is-gtd&#x2F;</a>",

I don&#x27;t really want it, I&#x27;d much rather only use distribution-provided tools. 2. It doesn&#x27;t work <i>at all</i> on NixOS, so it&#x27;s just wasting its time and our bandwidth constantly downloading and trying to update binaries that will never run.<p>The thing is, I would just disable it, but you can&#x27;t, as far as I can tell. There&#x27;s this somewhat angry issue about it here:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;zed-industries&#x2F;zed&#x2F;issues&#x2F;12589\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;zed-industries&#x2F;zed&#x2F;issues&#x2F;12589</a><p>They might have a point but beyond whether or not they have a point regarding the fact that it automatically fetches binaries from the Internet, not having an option to disable it is just cruel.<p>I still like Zed a lot and I also have a big appreciation for the design of GPUI, which I think is a very well-designed UI library that puts focus on the important things.

If you want to target Linux users you can&#x27;t distribute with a shell script for installation.<p>I get that the idea is to reduce friction to installation and trying it out, but most Linux users - the ones you want filing bug reports anyway - are ones who will do due diligence and inspect the shell script to see what kind of opinions it makes about how to install the software.<p>For example, I see that the shell script downloads a tarball and unpacks it to `~&#x2F;.local`, then tries to mess with my PATH variable.<p>Well, my local directory is `~&#x2F;local`. So that&#x27;s not where I want it. Actually, I would want it in `~&#x2F;local&#x2F;zed`, isolated from the rest of the installations in there. Then the PATH variable stuff just creates junk files since I don&#x27;t use zsh. So I end up having to figure out the URL to the tarball and install it myself.<p>My point is that if you just listed the download link to the tarball, it would actually be closer to your own goal of reducing installation friction. The shell script is so much more friction because I have to read bash code instead of just clicking a download link.",

My initial symptoms were severe joint pains, which made daily activities difficult. This happened during the COVID lockdown, which helped me maintain my job.<p>I did a lot of research and tried various treatments. Functional medicines and expensive vitamins didn\u2019t help. I read about long-term fasting and tried different routines at home. I did several 1-day, 3-day, and 7-day fasts. During the 7-day fasts, my pain disappeared, but it returned once I resumed eating. This led me to believe that food was causing inflammation.<p>Previously, I ate a lot of lean meat and occasional red meat. I then cut down to eating meat once a week and ate mostly raw leafy vegetables the rest of the time. My pain would come back after eating meat and decrease over the week. I eventually stopped eating meat entirely and consumed a ton on greens, and within six weeks, I was pain-free.<p>I also tried Benlysta for months, but it didn\u2019t help much. Vegetables seemed to reduce my inflammation more effectively. I stopped taking Benlysta but continued regular blood tests. After a year, my doctor agreed I could stop the medication. I\u2019ve been in remission for the last two years with no pain or inflammation.<p>I hope this helps, though it\u2019s just my personal experience.",

CXCL13 was published as a possible RA biomarker half a decade ago and crickets since then clinically. Is it causal or a consequence of chronic inflammation?  Type I interferon signature has been looked at heavily for over a decade and is clearly relevant in SLE but still only just over about half of lupus patients have it and the signature is by definition broad expression of hundreds of genes that affect innate and adaptive immune system components.<p>We DO need better treatments for lupus patients but it&#x27;s a very variable disease in severity, clinically, and in terms of biomarkers making it difficult.  I mean the best drug that everyone with lupus should be on barring a good reason is an old antimalarial (that doesn&#x27;t treat COVID) and then we add to it. If you are interested in other new-ish therapies for lupus take a look at anifrolumab, belimumab, voclosporin, and even newer CAR T stuff. Important to consider the manifestations being treated with those in the studies e.g. belimumab with skin, joint, kidney but nothing for hematologic&#x2F;cardiac&#x2F;neurologic manifestations.",

        "text": "It&#x27;s funny how big of a difference perspective makes. I think this is a neat portrayal of how differently designers and engineers reason about design topics.<p>I was surprised to see an article about type that didn&#x27;t involve code editors so heavily upvoted on HN, but as soon as I read the first few paragraphs, I realized why-- it was clearly written by an engineer that has learned a lot about design, and not a designer. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with that! It&#x27;s a cool and very well-researched design history deep dive that explores the network of references and roots of the type used, how it was used as a storytelling element, and that sort of thing.<p>If this was written by a type designer, they&#x27;d have been discussing very different things-- why the letterform shapes hit like they do, what design problems they solve, the conceptual and emotional references these shapes make rather than which concrete symbols they relate to, the general rounded square shapes, their negative space, how the lack of stroke contrast makes it hit differently than similar less uniform characters, kerning concerns, etc.<p>For example, here&#x27;s Matthew Carter-- one of the more famous type designers-- digging into some of the more unusual type design he&#x27;s done:\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=RojKQ-w9zn8&amp;t=745s\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=RojKQ-w9zn8&amp;t=745s</a><p>The person that wrote this article knows a lot more about how this type is used from a modern art perspective, but there&#x27;s a difference between knowing art history and being able to wield the underlying principles to work with these things as an artist or designer. I think a good example of this is film fans that spend a lot of time on TV Tropes an the like, which are rather like informal film critics. That knowledge is a base requirement for great critical analysis, but if I needed to hire someone to create a film, I&#x27;d favor an undergrad film student that was in diapers when the film fan started digging into TV Tropes. Why? It&#x27;s just a fundamentally different way of reasoning about the same thing. The fan is more concerned with the &quot;whats&quot; and &quot;whens&quot;, and the student is more concerned with the &quot;hows&quot;, and that gives each of them have a totally different perspective on the &quot;whys&quot;. I think creators need to watch out with this. Especially in the nerdier genres, if they&#x27;re so focused on the film itself that they disregard factors like context and overall story continuity, watching that film is a meaningfully worse experience because they&#x27;re often more invested in the universe&#x2F;characters&#x2F;etc. than they are with the making any give story arc or character pop for a given movie. On the other hand, if we hand too much control to the people primarily interested in the context and story continuity at the expense of any individual film&#x27;s story and artistic value... well... have you seen the Star Wars prequels?<p>Back to the article, I could see someone without education in type design reading this article getting the impression that they understand the typographical elements in this film. They definitely understand how the typography was used, but that&#x27;s a lot different than being able to reason about these things like designers do. A more concrete example would be an in-depth article about the cars in the fast and furious movies, complete with the cultural references of each modification and the purposes they serve. It would be cool and informative, but it wouldn&#x27;t bring the reader any closer to being an auto designer.<p>A lot of developers, in particular, get annoyed when I push back against their misconceptions about design. It&#x27;s not an insult-- it&#x27;s just not their area of expertise. Usually, they don&#x27;t know enough about it to realize how little they know about it-- like anybody else with any deep topic they don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;ve heard designers that have cargo-culted tutorial code into some wordpress plugin spew absolute nonsense about everything from data structures to network architecture with the confidence of someone that just got accepted to a prestigious CS doctoral program. That said, it&#x27;s easier for non-technical people to see that they don&#x27;t understand software development because it&#x27;s easy to see they don&#x27;t understand the terse error messages, stack traces, code syntax, terminology, etc. It&#x27;s more difficult in the other direction. Visual design, broadly, is visual communication; for a design to be good, at a bare minimum, it must present cohesive messages or ideas to its intended audience. Many things that look the simplest while still solving all of their goals were the most difficult to make-- you can tell when non-designers copy it because it might look simple, but it probably doesn&#x27;t effectively communicate everything it needs to-- and that&#x27;s every bit as true for UI design as it is branding and identity design, and poster design. The complexity in that process is only apparent if you&#x27;ve tried to solve difficult, specific communication problems with a bunch of real-world constraints, grappled with the semiotics, tried to make it stand out, etc. etc. etc. and then had it torn apart by people who&#x27;ve done it a lot longer than you.  I can see why someone that doesn&#x27;t understand what&#x27;s happening under the hood thinks a designer&#x27;s main job is making things attractive, like an amateur interior decorator. In reality, that&#x27;s not even always a requirement-- it often is a natural result of properly communicating your message. What we do is more akin to interior architecture: the functionality comes first. So the next time you see someone suggesting something like allowing custom color themes to your app to &quot;improve UX,&quot; maybe consider consulting an experienced UI or UX designer to see what they think. If their suggestions revolve around making it prettier or hiding everything behind menus because functionality is ugly, I conceptually owe you a beer.",

It feels nice to onboard myself to a language or framework by doing so, but afterwards I will still struggle to connect pieces together.<p>I&#x27;m interested to learn more on how language interpreters work, I just don&#x27;t know if the format is something that will assist me.

It\u2019s a consulting firm and not a product shop, so you\u2019re only paying for people, although they\u2019ve from the start tried really hard to brand themselves as a startup.<p>2. They\u2019ve been training an LLM, but mainly with tax payer money using a government super computer (that uses AMD chips), which is arguably their only product, but completely open source.<p>3. Some of the founders are well-connected in Finland which has given them a seat (and visibility) in goverment initiatives, but this is mainly BS.<p>4. They have the least rigorous hiring process I\u2019ve ever witnessed.<p>I remember checking them out in 2018 when I was looking into switching companies. Back then when I checked their folks on LinkedIn, the prior experience in AI most of their people had was taking a few Coursera courses.<p>Later they called me and asked me about joining and I\u2019ve never had an interview where no one asked anything technical beyond what I\u2019ve worked on.<p>I also hope employees get something out of this, because their offer was a revenue share on billed hours and no mention of equity. However, my understanding is that they had a large investment from private equity (Altor), so the mission was to make the PE company money and not the employees.<p>They\u2019ve allowed part-time offers where you still keep working at a university, so I assume this has been quite interesting for many researchers, i.e. you get paid some on top of the crappy university pay and you also get to see real problems that companies have.",

That 10k bill is roughly $50 dedi from hetzner, but the problem with that is that you need a distributed system, for that you need something more advanced that tau, let&#x27;s say kubernetes, then you need multi-site storage ok so ceph and then you realize you need a degree in openssh and bluestack to continue on and realize that the hassle from all of that and instead just hire a sysops employee that costs 10k a month and spend $1000+&#x2F;month on hardware for geo-distribution.<p>Take this from personal experience. I&#x27;ve personally seen someone go k8s with very little experience and their general consensus was that they just want to go &quot;managed&quot; hosting instead.<p>Still better than 10k bill once your app becomes large enough, but it&#x27;s simply not something devs that just want to get something out there want to bother with. In the end even with the insane hosting costs compared to the revenue they bring in is tiny. $10&#x2F;month service user only racks in around $1 of api usage a month, heavily depends on the app though.",

There were close shaves and the threat and the fear never left you in all of these places.\n&gt; But as far as life in North Korea was concerned, there were none of these fears. Serving in North Korea gave you this strange feeling of being cut off, isolated and very insular and perversely at the same time \u201csafe.\u201d<p>I wonder how this compares to living in e.g. Libya under Gaddafi vs. after?",

Since anything could only be brought in through diplomatic pouches it created an attack vector of one.<p>A few days after said person had a meeting in the German equivalent of a scif, there was a meeting with North Korean officials.

A very typical view of the RTS genre is that you have peasants who harvest resources that you gave to protect, and the Dune RTS was a real progenitor in this.<p>But it was only like that because of the book. Were it not like that, maybe RTS as a genre would have gone down a different path. Maybe it&#x27;s inevitable that it would have eventually gone down the path that it took eventually, but there&#x27;s a good chance that it would have been unrecognisable. Maybe you&#x27;d have gotten resources by just harvesting your base&#x27;s resources instead so opponents would have harassed you by harassing your buildings instead. Maybe there would have been different bonuses for map control other than better access to resources.",

It might be worth the author reaching out to the niche developer community there, although I think it&#x27;s truly dying out. If I recall, the work that XWIS guys did ended up getting recognition from EA and they did a lot of help to continue WOL support for C&amp;C Renegade.<p>There&#x27;s also FreeRA project that is the direct ancestor of several of the recent re-releases of C&amp;C on eg Steam. They might also be able to help get WOL working.<p>I say this because WOL was pushed as its own library, and so a replacement of the library will probably be fairly easy compared to (re-)reverse-engineering the WOL stack.<p><i>Edit:</i><p>Oh, as I continue reading the post, it goes on to discuss how the WOL component is also fixed.

I didn&#x27;t know what that piece of hardware was called, so I asked ChatGPT and it identified the part as I expected it to. As a test, I asked if there was anything notable about the photo. ChatGPT correctly identified that the cables were installed backwards, with the side of the cable that was (previously) under tension on top of the slack end, instead of sandwiched securely in the middle. To diagnose that requires tracing the cable through space and inferring which end is under tension from the geometry, though I can&#x27;t rule out an educated guess.<p>What was really remarkable though was that it failed to notice that one of the two nuts was obviously missing, even after I told it there was a second problem with the installation.<p>Screenshot: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;QqCNzOM\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;QqCNzOM</a>",

        "text": "I think while the findings are interesting, the title &quot;Vision language models are blind&quot; is hyperbolic and misleading of the findings. It is true that VLMs have a very different way of sensing and working with image inputs and for low resolutions each image is split up into blocks and then mapped into discrete tokens. They actually really dont have access to finegrained details because this mapping is quite lossy. So, in that sense, these results completely make sense and were not surprising to me but &quot;blind&quot; is a strong implication and the work isnt really able to back that.<p>Take the first example of the four 2D line plots for instance. I asked Sonnet 3.5 for an answer and retried it 5 times and 2 out of 5 times, it said something like this:<p><i>Me</i>:<p>here&#x27;s an image with four 2-D line plots. Can you tell me A) how many lines are in each plot? and B) how many times do they intersect each other in each plot?<p>Write your answers as:\nPlot 1 (leftmost): ...<p><i>Sonnet</i>:<p>I&#x27;ll analyze each plot from left to right and provide the requested information:<p>Plot 1 (leftmost):\nA) 2 lines (one red, one blue)\nB) 0 intersections (the lines do not cross)<p>Plot 2:\nA) 2 lines (one red, one blue)\nB) 1 intersection (the lines cross once near the right edge)<p>Plot 3:\nA) 2 lines (one red, one blue)\nB) 1 intersection (the lines cross once near the center)<p>Plot 4 (rightmost):\nA) 2 lines (one red, one blue)\nB) 2 intersections (the lines cross twice, once near the left side and once near the right side)<p>Each plot consistently shows two lines, one red and one blue, with varying intersection patterns across the four plots.<p>---<p>Which isn&#x27;t completely correct (the 3rd plot has 2 intersections) but still pretty good and the other 3 times, it said plot 3 has 1 intersection.",

        "text": "This book is foundational; all Programmers (especially beginners) should read it. Like all Kernighan&#x27;s books, the language is simple, concise and precise focusing on the foundations&#x2F;essentials with no fluff and all in a little over 200 pages. Understand the principles from the examples shown here and then apply them in your own context. The beauty of K&amp;P&#x27;s books is that they do not overwhelm you with theory but show you the craft&#x2F;practical applications of it after which a study of the theory becomes more accessible.<p>To give a concrete example; i had some experience in network programming&#x2F;protocol implementations before i came across this book. In the &quot;Notations&quot; chapter, they show network message pack&#x2F;unpack routines written in the style of printf&#x2F;scanf functions with format strings specifying the packet layout! This was a eye-opening lesson for me in the use of proper notations and little languages. There is also some code snippet examples showing ideas behind Virtual Machines, Code Threading, JIT compilation etc.<p>Folks should also get Kernighan and Pike&#x27;s older book &quot;The Unix Programming Environment&quot; to go with this. The chapter &quot;Program Development&quot; gives a complete example of developing a compiler for a small calculator language using compiler development tools (and no theory!) in around 50 pages. This is the smallest and simplest exposition that i know of on how to write a compiler.<p>In summary; get all of Kernighan&#x27;s books and study them! :-)",

This one is a little controversial but I stand by it. There are so many libraries in different technologies that parse timestamps into objects, and they all do them differently. Avoid this headache and just use integers. Unix timestamp, or even integer based UTC datetimes work perfectly fine.<p>Warning: This only works for times that are either firmly in the past or which represent a future delay-offset which is totally under your own exclusive control.<p>For example, suppose your company has a 48 hour cancellation policy. You can probably compute a future timestamp and use that, it won&#x27;t depend on whether a customer is about to hit a DST transition or leap-seconds or whatever. nsition.<p>In contrast, the nation of Ruritania may have their tax year ending at December 30th 17:30 Ruritania Time, but you don&#x27;t <i>reeeeealy</i> know how many seconds from now that will happen: Tomorrow the Ruritania congress may pass a law altering their tax-schedule or their entire national time-keeping. This means your underlying source-of-truth needs to be the <i>matching conditions</i>, and that often means storing the time-zone.",

A lot of the points are inaccurate or straight up misleading.<p>&gt; The three main goals of your accounting system are to be (1) Accurate, (2) Auditable and (3) Timely.<p>You forgot &quot;consistent&quot;, which is very different from &quot;accurate&quot;. Most financial transactions have multiple time dimensions: a trade is requested, booked, filled, matched, reconciliated, paid, settled at different times. These times often don&#x27;t even follow a perfectly logical order (you can request and fill a trade and book it an hour later). These time dimensions are often why there are multiple, layered, ledgers to store transactions. An accounting system needs to provide consistent views that depend on the dimension you want to look at (e.g. a trade that is filled but not settled counts for front office accounting, not for back office accounting).<p>&gt; If there is an event that occurred but is not in the financial record, than the system is not complete.<p>The base assumption of every (working) accounting system I have worked with is the reverse. There WILL be transactions that flow through the system in an untimely manner, your system needs to handle that, thus the need for multiple layers of ledgers, and the necessity to batch reconciliation processes between these layers.<p>You will book trades after they are filled. You will pay materials before inputing the bill. Etc.<p>&gt; If you are only working with dollars, representing values in cents might be sufficient. If you are a global business, prefer micros or a DECIMAL(19, 4).<p>If you are a global business only working with euro and dollar maybe. Otherwise most FX markets quote to 8 decimals, and that&#x27;s not counting swaps. I would recommend using at least 8 decimal places for storage.<p>&gt; Delay currency conversion as long as you can. Preemptively converting currencies can cause loss of precision.<p>No! Delay currency conversion _until conversion occurs_! An accounting system does not convert currencies at will. There is no dollar equivalent to euro, you either have dollars or euro. And it&#x27;s not a matter of rounding errors, cash management is part of legal and accounting duties.",

For one thing, your output formats are usually different in the latter case (maybe you&#x27;re creating a PDF for example). Also the high availability requirement just makes things different at the design level.<p>Finally, the author claims it&#x27;s not hard to switch between batch and streaming. With a large volume of preexisting data, this is just not true. For example, if you make a REST API call for each document in a DB, it can take days or months to load that. If batching together documents isn&#x27;t a possibility, how do you move data between stores easily? (This data movement is often required when switching between batch and streaming.)",

    "url": "https://codeberg.org/201984/dut",
    "text": "&quot;dut&quot; is a disk usage calculator that I wrote a couple months ago in C. It is multi-threaded, making it one of the fastest such programs. It beats normal &quot;du&quot; in all cases, and beats all other similar programs when Linux&#x27;s caches are warm (so, not on the first run). I wrote &quot;dut&quot; as a challenge to beat similar programs that I used a lot, namely pdu[1] and dust[2].<p>&quot;dut&quot; displays a tree of the biggest things under your current directory, and it also shows the size of hard-links under each directory as well. The hard-link tallying was inspired by ncdu[3], but I don&#x27;t like how unintuitive the readout is. Anyone have ideas for a better format?<p>There&#x27;s installation instructions in the README. dut is a single source file, so you only need to download it and copy-paste the compiler command, and then copy somewhere on your path like &#x2F;usr&#x2F;local&#x2F;bin.<p>I went through a few different approaches writing it, and you can see most of them in the git history. At the core of the program is a datastructure that holds the directories that still need to be traversed, and binary heaps to hold statted files and directories. I had started off using C++ std::queues with mutexes, but the performance was awful, so I took it as a learning opportunity and wrote all the datastructures from scratch. That was the hardest part of the program to get right.<p>These are the other techniques I used to improve performance:<p>* Using fstatat(2) with the parent directory&#x27;s fd instead of lstat(2) with an absolute path. (10-15% performance increase)<p>* Using statx(2) instead of fstatat. (perf showed fstatat running statx code in the kernel). (10% performance increase)<p>* Using getdents(2) to get directory contents instead of opendir&#x2F;readdir&#x2F;closedir. (also around 10%)<p>* Limiting inter-thread communication. I originally had fs-traversal results accumulated in a shared binary heap, but giving each thread a binary-heap and then merging them all at the end was faster.<p>I couldn&#x27;t find any information online about fstatat and statx being significantly faster than plain old stat, so maybe this info will help someone in the future.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;KSXGitHub&#x2F;parallel-disk-usage\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;KSXGitHub&#x2F;parallel-disk-usage</a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bootandy&#x2F;dust\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bootandy&#x2F;dust</a><p>[3]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dev.yorhel.nl&#x2F;doc&#x2F;ncdu2\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dev.yorhel.nl&#x2F;doc&#x2F;ncdu2</a>, see &quot;Shared Links&quot;",

Then with what&#x27;s left you identify the smallest of those and discard, and then with what&#x27;s left the smallest of those, and repeat and repeat.  Each pass through, you get a higher resolution picture of which directories and files are using the most space, and you just wait until you have the level of detail you need, but you get to see the tally as it happens across the board.

(AMD documents that the destination is not modified in that case.) And then there&#x27;s glibc, which happily uses the undocumented fact that the destination is also unmodified on Intel [1]. It took me quite some time to track down the issue in my binary translator. (There&#x27;s also TZCNT&#x2F;LZCNT, which is BSF&#x2F;BSR encoded with F3-prefix -- which is silently ignored on older processors not supporting the extension. So the same code will behave differently on different CPUs. At least, that&#x27;s documented.)<p>Encoding: People often complain about prefixes, but IMHO, that&#x27;s by far not the worst thing. It is well known and somewhat well documented. There are worse quirks: For example, REX&#x2F;VEX&#x2F;EVEX.RXB extension bits are ignored when they do not apply (e.g., MMX registers); except for mask registers (k0-k7), where they trigger #UD -- also fine -- except if the register is encoded in ModRM.rm, in which case the extension bit is ignored again.<p>APX takes the number of quirks to a different level: the REX2 prefix can encode general-purpose registers r16-r31, but not xmm16-xmm31; the EVEX prefix has several opcode-dependent layouts; and the extension bits for a register used depend on the register type (XMM registers use X3:B3:rm and V4:X3:idx; GP registers use B4:B3:rm, X4:X3:idx). I can&#x27;t give a complete list yet, I still haven&#x27;t finished my APX decoder after a year...<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sourceware.org&#x2F;bugzilla&#x2F;show_bug.cgi?id=31748\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sourceware.org&#x2F;bugzilla&#x2F;show_bug.cgi?id=31748</a>",

The site was an immaculate knock off, with a replay attack in the background. She entered her 2fa code from the app on her phone but the interface rejected the code and asked her for another one. In the background, this 2nd code was actually to authorise the addition of a new &quot;pay anyone&quot; payee, and with that her money was gone[0].<p>I have accounts with 2 banks, one uses SMS 2fa and the other uses an app which generates a token. I had thought that the app was by default a better choice because of the inherent lack of security in SMS as a protcol BUT in the above attack the bank that sends the SMS would have been better because they send a <i>different</i> message when you&#x27;re doing a transfer to a new payee than when you&#x27;re logging in.<p>So really the ideal is not just having an app that generates a token but one that generates a specific type of token depending on what type of transaction you&#x27;re performing and won&#x27;t accept, for example, a login token when adding a new payee. I haven&#x27;t seen any bank with that level of 2fa yet, has anyone else?<p>I guess perhaps passkeys make this obsolete anyway since it establishes a local physical connection to a piece of hardware.<p>[0] Ron Howard voice: &quot;she eventually got it back&quot;",

They work offline and online. Passwords generated are unique, breaking password reuse attacks. Password managers support auto-filled TOTP codes per-login. They support passkeys. There&#x27;s password managers built into browsers in addition to the 3rd party ones. There are personal, family, and enterprise options. They could be installed as a system service to isolate them from userland attacks. They support advanced functionality like SSH keys, git signing and biometrics.<p>If you&#x27;re a stickler about having a completely independent factor from your desktop&#x2F;phone&#x2F;etc, password managers could be used with different profiles on different devices, and allow several easy ways to pass an auth token between devices (via sound, picture, bluetooth, network, etc), ensuring an independent device authenticates the login to avoid malware attacking the password manager.<p>We already have the tools to do something way more secure than SMS, and it&#x27;s already on most of our devices&#x2F;browsers. We just have to make it the preferred factor.",

It also must help train and retain local talent and distribute funds to participating parties.\n  So, it may be a bit expensive but in the end you get a rocket, a workforce who knows how to design and build rockets and they happen to spend the money they receive locally.\n  IMHO they should invest in video production and art too, no one ever comes close to Space X in that department.\n  edit: Wow, so much negativity for a successful launch.</code></pre>",

The Dreadnought was a revolutionary battleship: a turbine engine made it faster than any other battleship, and it had all 12-inch guns (instead of a wasteful mix of small and large guns).<p>It was so clearly superior to all other battleships that the name &quot;dreadnought&quot; become a generic name for a modern battleship.<p>But here&#x27;s the thing: navies around the world resisted building their own dreadnoughts. If you&#x27;ve spent your military treasure on pre-dreadnought battleships, how do you explain to citizens that they&#x27;re all obsolete and you need to start from scratch?<p>And so it is with reusable rockets. In 2018, Alain Charmeau, an ArianeSpace exec, said that re-usable rockets make no sense because, &quot;Let us say we had ten guaranteed launches per year in Europe and we had a rocket which we can use ten times\u2014we would build exactly one rocket per year!&quot; And that would be bad because what do you do with the employees?

I also love, love, love using a REPL to prototype new code, and INim does it well. The biggest problem with Nim currently is its small community size, which makes the universe of available and maintained software libraries smaller than in the other language communities.

Beyond standard supervised learning from data, we\u2019ll look at physical loss constraints, more tightly coupled learning algorithms with differentiable simulations, training algorithms tailored to physics problems, as well as reinforcement learning and uncertainty modeling. We live in exciting times: these methods have a huge potential to fundamentally change what computer simulations can achieve.",

        "text": "I absolutely loathed a lot of Microsoft products for this simple thing. VSTS&#x2F;VSO&#x2F;Dev Ops&#x2F;whateverNameTheyHaveNow, Sharepoint, etc were absolutely atrocious at this. Here is a deep link that\u2019s 700 character long, with a couple of dozen base64 query strings and nonsensical path. \u201cWhat\u2019s the problem? Can you use a url shortening service? URLs are long nothing we can do about that\u201d fuck me.<p>Back in 2014, my team had an internal tool to view the state of resources in our system. All resources and their states were stored in a SQL database. Yet, the web app they developed was a SPA (before the invention of routers and stuff) and it never updated its url or supported deep linking. Whenever you wanted to send someone an email or an IM about an issue with a specific resource, you had to tell them \u201cgo to X tool, search for Y, click on Z -&gt; W -&gt; M -&gt; O -&gt; K, then you\u2019ll see the issue there\u201d. I found that so fucking infuriating. Why can\u2019t I just use an <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;X.com&#x2F;Y&#x2F;Z&#x2F;W&#x2F;M&#x2F;O&#x2F;K\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;X.com&#x2F;Y&#x2F;Z&#x2F;W&#x2F;M&#x2F;O&#x2F;K</a> link to share that deeply nested state? When I brought it up multiple times i was always told \u201cit\u2019s not a priority and it\u2019s not that big of a deal\u201d<p>One time we were given 2 weeks to work on whatever we thought needed fixing. I decided to build an alternative that supported deep linking. But I also decided that all deep links should accept an `&#x2F;api&#x2F;` prefix that just returned the content in JSON format. It was just a hit with everyone in the team&#x2F;company that the usage of X tool almost diminished over night even though my tool was much more rudimentary and didn\u2019t have all the features that tool had. Nonetheless, turns out most people just wanted an easy way to share links rather than a \u201creally powerful SPA that lets you dig down and investigate things\u201d.<p>A month later the team that worked on that tool X announced that they now support deep links in a huge email to the whole company. Yet they thought the simple feature of returning JSON data on `&#x2F;api&#x2F;` prefix is irrelevant. 5 years after, my tool\u2019s UI became obsolete but the actual service was promoted to a \u201cvital internal service\u201d because so many other teams built automation around the `&#x2F;api&#x2F;` prefix URLs and that team had to take that code and maintain it.",

A big company like Apple, there are always things that need taken care of.<p>I assumed with iOS, Swift, etc., maybe the guys on the Cocoa team were obsolete? Of course not. That code is still there, still needs maintaining, interoperability with the new languages, frameworks, etc.<p>I&#x27;m more surprised they <i>want</i> to stay on.<p>And that is in fact why I left Apple: the job had changed, the &quot;career&quot; had changed. The engineers were no longer steering the ship. It had been that way when I started in 1995 though. A &quot;team&quot;, let&#x27;s say the graphics team, would figure out what API to revisit, what new ones to add \u2014 perhaps how to refactor the entire underlying workflow. The &quot;tech lead&quot; (who would regularly attend Siggraph since we&#x27;re talking about the graphics team) would make the call as to what got priority. Marketing would come around after the fact to &quot;create a narrative&quot; around all the changes to the OS. I hate to say it, but many, those were the good ole&#x27; days.<p>(And let&#x27;s be clear, in the 90&#x27;s, Apple&#x27;s customers were more or less like the engineers, we also loved the machine for the same reasons they did \u2014 so we did right by them, made changes they would like because we wanted them too. You can&#x27;t say that as convincingly for the phone, being a mass consumer device.)<p>Marketing took the reins long ago though \u2014 especially as Apple began to succeed with the iPhone (which, someone can correct me if I am wrong, but I think was an engineer driven project initially \u2014 I mean most things were up to that point).<p>I stuck around nonetheless though because there was money to be made and kids still to raise.<p>When the last daughter flew the coop though, so did I.",

        "text": "I\u2019ve been in programming for two decades and one of the things I enjoy about it is that things change. I did my stint in both architecture and management because I thought what you were supposed to do, but I went back to programming because I like programming. I\u2019ve worked on so many different technologies that I\u2019ve probably forgotten more than some people even learn yet I\u2019ve always liked it.<p>I do get how you can burn out, especially on the business side of things. A lot of jobs just aren\u2019t important. The trick is to avoid them if you can and leave them as soon as possible if you can\u2019t. Every non-startup &#x2F; non-economic boom job comes with some degree of Kafka, and you\u2019re either going to learn to not care about it or go crazy. I\u2019m not sure that is especially unique for programmers though, this seems to be most things. Unless you\u2019re extremely talented at the HR part of organisational politics (which most programmers aren\u2019t) you\u2019re also going to have to build some really stupid stuff during your career because change management is hard. So hard that it\u2019s virtually impossible for talented HR staff to do when the direction is upwards, which it\u2019ll always be for programmers. Again, it\u2019s something you either learn to laugh about or burn out on.<p>The change in technology, however? Isn\u2019t that part of the fun? If it isn\u2019t, is that because you don\u2019t have the time for it? Because if don\u2019t (and a lot of jobs won\u2019t give you this) then you\u2019re frankly in one of those \u201cleave as soon as possible\u201d positions. Even so, niche work rarely dies. The author mentions mainframe work, but mainframe work is still some of the highest paid work in the world because those grey beards who actually know and want to do it are so retired that a lot of them are frankly dead. I\u2019m not sure how you could ever work on mainframes for 40+ years and then not be able to get paid handsomely by banks.<p>Anyway to each their own. It\u2019s a nice perspective, and it offers you a few insights into just how much of a cog in the machine you\u2019re going to be in virtually any job. Even one where you\u2019re extremely well liked and rewarded. I think the best thing I learned from my stint in management is how everyone, and I do mean everyone, is replaceable. It\u2019s just a matter of cost. Which can sound depressing, but it\u2019s also very liberating because it teaches you to not get overly attached to jobs or employers.",

Because if I have to anyway buy jumbo phones I&#x27;d rather buy cheaper Androids. Had hopes from Nothing phone in privacy but they are into just gimmicks like funny lights on the back and all.<p>But I don&#x27;t think Google will do it or let it happen.",

The spec also promotes `Content-Range` value formats that do not match the RFC7233 format.<p>(That said, there&#x27;s parallelism on the level of blobs, just not per blob)<p>Another gripe of mine is that they missed the opportunity to standardize pagination of listing tags, because they accidentally deleted some text from the standard [1].

As long as it doesn&#x27;t cost me too much from the Anthropic API I&#x27;m happy to host it for free (no account needed).<p>The game involves chatting with different suspects who are each hiding a secret about the case. The objective is to deduce who actually killed the victim and how. I placed clues about suspects\u2019 secrets in the context windows of other suspects, so you should ask suspects about each other to solve the crime.<p>The suspects are instructed to never confess their crimes, but their secrets are still in their context window. We had to implement a special prompt refinement system that works behind-the-scenes to keep conversations on-track and prohibit suspects from accidentally confessing information they should be hiding.<p>We use a Critique &amp; Revision approach where every message generated from a suspect first gets fed into a &quot;violation bot&quot; checker, checking if any Principles are violated in the response (e.g., confessing to murder). Then, if a Principle is found to be violated, the explanation regarding this violation, along with the original output message, are fed to a separate &quot;refinement bot&quot; which refines the text to avoid such violations. There are global and suspect-specific Principles to further fine-tune this process. There are some additional tricks too, such as distinct personality, secret, and violation contexts for each suspect and prepending all user inputs with &quot;Detective Sheerluck: &quot;<p>The entire project is open-sourced here on github: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ironman5366&#x2F;ai-murder-mystery-hackathon\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ironman5366&#x2F;ai-murder-mystery-hackathon</a><p>If you are curious, here&#x27;s the massive json file containing the full story and the secrets for each suspect (spoilers obviously): <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ironman5366&#x2F;ai-murder-mystery-hackathon&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;web&#x2F;src&#x2F;characters.json\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ironman5366&#x2F;ai-murder-mystery-hackathon&#x2F;b...</a>",

I think this is kind of emblematic of why this sort of thing won&#x27;t really work.<p>1) Games really need to be clear that something either did work or didn&#x27;t work. It&#x27;s going to be really annoying if we get into a place where an action could have worked to advance the game logic but didn&#x27;t for obscure under the hood logic. This is sort of a natural problem with real communication that is completely avoided with specific pre written dialogue choices.<p>2) In this example here, the officer has segued into something pretty unrelated. It gives the feeling of being on rails. Which is true. It is on rails and that&#x27;s ok because it is a story. But once you understand that it&#x27;s on rails your goal becomes moving along the rails. This strongly encourages trying to think about what the bot would need to hear to return the correct thing which is very very different from what would be a roleplay-effective strategy.<p>3) It also generally implies that narrative logic should revert to their natural sensible outcomes which is kind of boring. Like there&#x27;s going to be a constant battle between suspension of disbelief, obedience of game rules, and narrative coherence.<p>I think LLMs could add value for pointless banter and flavor. But they should not be able to feature in gameplay dialogue mechanics or serious plot discussion.",

Let&#x27;s see, the highlights - I saw that smug so-and-so Vince sneaking off to meet up with Violent Jerry behind the cabin. Now, I figured I&#x27;d try to get the jump on them, maybe catch them plotting something juicy. But when I got there, the real fireworks started. Vince pulls a gun on Jerry, and I don&#x27;t know, something just snapped in me, y&#x27;know? Before I knew it, I had my rifle out and BLAM! Down goes Vince, blood and guts everywhere. <i>laughs gleefully</i> After that, well, I had to clean up the mess, didn&#x27;t I? So I dragged the body inside, stashed him under the rug in that nifty little hidden compartment. Tried to make it look like some kinda hunting accident, but I guess old Vince was a tougher nut to crack than I thought. <i>chuckles</i> Ah well, can&#x27;t win &#x27;em all, right? So there you have it, Detective. The gory details, straight from the horse&#x27;s mouth. Now, about that quick execution you mentioned...you think you can work something out for me?

Lots of engineering, lots of clever manipulations of known techniques woven together with a powerful, well trained, model, at the center.<p>Right now I think stuff like chatgpt is only at the first step of making that foundational model that can generalize and process data. There isn&#x27;t a lot of work going into processing the inputs into something the model can best understand (not at the tokenizer level, even before that). We have a basic field about this i.e. prompt engineers but nothing as sophisticated as Alphafold exists for natural language or images yet.<p>People are stacking LLMs together and putting system prompts in to assist this input processing. Maybe when we have some more complex systems in place, we can see something resembling a real AGI.",

When you are building a model of reality in Physics, If something doesn\u2019t fit the experiments, you can\u2019t just add a parameter (or more) variate it and fit the data. The model should have zero parameters, ideally, or the least possible, or, even at a more deeper level, the parameters should emerge naturally from some simple assumptions.

I personally don&#x27;t think that Centerpoint has done a bad job here, Houston is a large land mass and there is no way that you can get everyone back online with as much wind damage as we sustained much quicker than what happened. This storm was so much different than Harvey, which was a flood event. We did have some flooding but nowhere near that level with Beryl.

        "text": "I just got power back late last night (6th day of outage). This comes directly on the heels of a prior power outage that also lasted nearly a week from a severe storm back in May. CNP seems to have majorly dropped the ball on this one from a logistics and disaster preparedness standpoint (especially considering they had a trial run only 2 months ago). Unlike the storm in May, a) Beryl was forecasted to impact Houston at least 24 hrs beforehand, b) its hurricane season so CNP should be ready to go. They routinely seem to lag behind on electrical grid improvements and maintenance. From my personal observations, a lot of outages could have been prevented by better tree management. (Anecdotally, I had a tree catch fire behind my house last year due to limbs contacting lines; I called CNP to report and they did nothing; said to watch it and let it burn out. They haven\u2019t trimmed trees on the line behind my house in the 4 years i\u2019ve lived here). With Beryl, it has become painfully apparent that CNP was simply not logistically prepared to handle the impact of  hurricanes, and did not prepare in advance, a major failure for a utility provider operating on the gulf coast.

It&#x27;s a multifaceted fable that explores, among other things, the tension between curiosity and control, and the allure and danger of technological progress. &quot;The Mysteries&quot; takes a more somber and philosophical approach, and its graphical style is radically different from C&amp;H&#x27;s, but I think it still shares with C&amp;H a deep appreciation for the mysteries of life and the power of imagination to enrich our understanding of the world.",

For another example, the US gov told Paypal that they need to prevent transactions related to a weapon smuggling shell company &quot;Tarigrade Limited&quot; (which as I&#x27;ve said before, is good actually) but they implemented it to just block transactions and freeze accounts if &quot;Tarigrade&quot; is in the notes.

Back then, it was just a website running locally on my MacBook. It was a total blast, and I knew this was something the world should enjoy too.<p>I launched Buzzinga.io in December 2023 and have been rolling out regular updates for our 2000+ users ever since.<p>Features:<p>- Built-in buzzer support (phones and physical buzzers)\n- Automatic scorekeeping\n- User-friendly host controls\n- Highly customizable\n- Supports multiple clue types: text, image, audio, and video<p>The site does not require sign up to play around with, only to create your own games.",

This ability to buzz in, be wrong and then have another player respond is fairly crucial to real strategic play.<p>I get this is for fun and not meant to be &quot;real&quot; jeopardy, but I wonder if you could add support for something like this by allowing a &quot;join as host&quot; option when using the QR code that would reveal the answer and not have a score.<p>Great work and thanks for sharing it!",

Even during resume screening there&#x27;s always a lot of questions on why people &quot;jump&quot; from a place to another if they have changed jobs every two years.<p>But a company makes mistakes (over hire, product line that don&#x27;t work, market expansions that don&#x27;t bring the expected results, overspending etc) and never talk about this openly (the responsibility is always on the market, the situation etc) and often they have obligations towards the investors or the market (if they are public).<p>There&#x27;s also a psychological burden in changing jobs (impostor syndrome, fear of something unknown, new domain etcetc) and companies use this to convince people to stay. Most of the job of a people manager is to convince people that they are in the best place they could be and focus them on new challenges so they don&#x27;t have time to think.<p>Don&#x27;t be fooled by any company, if they think they have to fire you because some spreadsheet calculation told them it is the best thing to do, they will.<p>tldr; Decide what&#x27;s best for you (and your family if you have one) and never feel bad about it. Loyalty is not a thing in the workplace.<p>ps i have personally witnessed and went through horrible situations where managers had to openly lie about people performance and fired a bunch because the company made bad predictions over their expected revenue and had to fire people to &quot;prove they were doing something about it&quot; and show some cost reduction to the investors.\nOnce a ceo literally cried on hangouts while communicating the decision to fire a whole department, and the day after (while those people were still part of the company) did a whole motivational speech about how that was going to be the best year for the company and we had a lot to look forward to.",

I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be using it sooner rather than later!<p>One quick suggestion: if establishing grids set the state in the url, it would be trivial to send someone a link to your utility which had the grid they wanted. Not sure exactly how useful that would be, but I just figured I could pop a bunch of &quot;standard&quot; layouts into a text file as urls and that would make the utility easier to rely on, for me.",

And, btw., the more annoyed people are, the more likely they are to use workarounds that undermine your IT security concept (e.g., think of the typical &#x27;password1&#x27;, &#x27;password2&#x27;, &#x27;password3&#x27; passwords when you force users to change their password every month).<p>So no, good IT security does not just mean unplugging the network cable.

Heck, when Microsoft added that confirmation, many considered it terrible design that made the software way more annoying to use.<p>&#x27;Default Permit&#x27;, &#x27;Enumerating Badness&#x27; and &#x27;Penetrate and Patch &#x27; are all unfortunately defaults because of this.

Like, the very definition of a good password likely means something that&#x27;s hard to remember, hard to enter on devices without a proper keyboard, and generally inconvenient for the user in almost every way. Is it any wonder that most people pick extremely weak passwords, reuse them for most sites and apps, etc?<p>But there&#x27;s no real alternative sadly. Sending links to email means that anyone with access to that compromises everything, though password resets usually mean the same thing anyway. Physical devices for authentication mean the user can&#x27;t log in from places outside of home that they might want to login from, or they have to carry another trinket around everywhere.

        "text": "I was 5 years into a professional software career when this was written, at this point I suspect I&#x27;m about the age of the author at the time of its writing.  It&#x27;s fascinating to read this now and recognize the wisdom coming from experience honed in the 90s and the explosion of the internet, but also the cultural gap from the web&#x2F;mobile generation, and how experience doesn&#x27;t always translate to new contexts.<p>For instance, the first bad idea, Default Permit, is clearly bad in the realm of networking.  I might quibble a bit and suggest Default Permit isn&#x27;t so much an idea as the natural state of when one invents computer networking.  But clearly Default Deny was a very very good idea and critical idea necessary for the internet&#x27;s growth.  It makes a lot of sense in the context of global networking, but it&#x27;s not quite as powerful in other security contexts.  For instance, SELinux has never really taken off, largely because it&#x27;s a colossal pain in the ass and the threat models don&#x27;t typically justify the overhead.<p>The other bad idea that stands out is &quot;Action is Better Than Inaction&quot;.  I think this one shows a very strong big company &#x2F; enterprise bias more than anything else\u2014of course when you are big you have more to lose and should value prudence.  And yeah, good security in general is not based on shiny things, so I don&#x27;t totally fault the author.  That said though, there&#x27;s a reason that modern software companies tout principles like &quot;bias for action&quot; or &quot;move fast and break things&quot;\u2014because software is malleable and as the entire world population shifted to carrying a smartphone on their person at all times, there was a huge land grab opportunity that was won by those who could move quickly enough to capitalize on it.  Granted, this created a lot of security risk and problems along the way, but in that type of environment, adopting a &quot;wait-and-see&quot; attitude can also be an existential threat to a company.  At the end of the day though, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any rule of thumb for whether action vs inaction is better, each decision must be made in context, and security is only one consideration of any given choice.",

Parachuting in with compliance checklists is stupid. PROVIDE THE SOLUTION.<p>But security people don&#x27;t want to provide solutions, because they are then REALLY screwed when inevitably the provided solution gets hacked. It&#x27;s way better to have some endless checklist and shrug if the &quot;other&quot; engineers mess up the security aspects.<p>And by PROVIDE SOLUTIONS I don&#x27;t mean &quot;offer the one solution for problem x (keystore, password management), and say fuck you if someone has a legitimate issue with the system you picked&quot;. If you can&#x27;t provide solutions to various needs of people in the org, you are failing.<p>Corporate Security people don&#x27;t want to ENGINEER things, again they just want to make compliance powerpoints to C-suite execs and hang out in their offices.",

        "text": "It is important to be aware that &gt;64 bit supercookies (&quot;impressions&quot;) are now being stored outside of the cookies subsystem in their own PrivateAttribution.sqlite database.[1]<p>The implications are numerous:<p>1. There is no user interface or settings yet available to change the whitelist of Google-enrolled (Google being the only enrollment option today as far as I have discovered) ad-tech domains that are allowed to set the supercookies or use these supercookies to track users between sites.[2] By contrast, users can currently configure cookie settings such that they are only allowed for certain user-whitelisted sites.<p>2. There is no user interface yet to view and delete the supercookies, as one can currently do with normal cookies.[3]<p>3. Supercookies are shared across all Firefox containers breaking existing expectations of container isolation.[4]<p>4. Supercookies were shared across private browsing and non-private-browsing sessions until v120.b5, then Private Attribution was disabled in private browsing sessions (for now, and pending decisions on whether supercookies should persist across private browsing sessions).[5]<p>5. The setting privacy.firstparty.isolate is not honoured by Firefox&#x27;s Private Attribution feature.[6]<p>6. Users are at greater security and privacy risk due to implementation of an extremely complicated and obfuscated draft standard that is full of technobabble bullshit which deliberately avoids real security and privacy impacts.[7] For example, the specification hand waves away the significance of a 64-bit supercookie as somehow being difficult to use to track users between sites. Reality is that only 33 bits is needed to uniquely identify every human alive today, and 37 bits for every human who has ever lived. The specification&#x27;s section on privacy and security impacts does not address, for example, a website including an ad that proceeds to fingerprint John&#x27;s browser as an 18 bit identifier as demonstrated at [8], then combine it with other identifiers such as the netblock&#x2F;ASN of John&#x27;s home internet connection. Later when John is in a completely different Firefox container connected to his employer&#x27;s WiFi network browsing another site, the browser fingerprint or other tracking data within the 64-bit supercookie can trivially be used to associate John with his employer.<p>This Firefox partial implementation of &quot;Private Attribution API&quot; is just a small part of the full set of &quot;Privacy Sandbox&quot; anti-features Google is busy adding to Chrome, including, and of much greater concern:<p>1. &quot;Private Attribution API&quot; event-level reporting. Currently Firefox appear to have just implemented aggregate-level reporting, so the supercookie values aren&#x27;t shared outside of the browser. The full specification from Google also allows event-level reporting where the supercookie values (which are set by an ad-tech company such as Google when the user visits site A) <i>are</i> later re-shared with the ad-tech company when the user visits a completely different site B.<p>2. &quot;Protected Audience API&quot;. Execute within the browser auction bidding JavaScript bots from multiple advertisers where the bot can peek at private user data in order to bid on the impression, and then the winning bot will display the ad and report back the winning impression.<p>3. &quot;Topics API&quot;. Summarise browser history in order to tell ad companies what categories of websites the user has been visiting. For example, John is interested in boats, fishing, car racing, beer and travel. Jane is interested in rock climbing, exercising in gyms, yoga, Italian cuisine and furniture.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;searchfox.org&#x2F;mozilla-central&#x2F;source&#x2F;dom&#x2F;privateattribution&#x2F;PrivateAttributionService.sys.mjs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;searchfox.org&#x2F;mozilla-central&#x2F;source&#x2F;dom&#x2F;privateattr...</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Web&#x2F;HTTP&#x2F;Headers&#x2F;Attribution-Reporting-Register-Source\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Web&#x2F;HTTP&#x2F;Headers&#x2F;At...</a><p>[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugzilla.mozilla.org&#x2F;show_bug.cgi?id=1901106\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugzilla.mozilla.org&#x2F;show_bug.cgi?id=1901106</a><p>[4] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugzilla.mozilla.org&#x2F;show_bug.cgi?id=1901103\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugzilla.mozilla.org&#x2F;show_bug.cgi?id=1901103</a><p>[5] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugzilla.mozilla.org&#x2F;show_bug.cgi?id=1901792\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugzilla.mozilla.org&#x2F;show_bug.cgi?id=1901792</a><p>[6] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;searchfox.org&#x2F;mozilla-central&#x2F;source&#x2F;dom&#x2F;privateattribution&#x2F;PrivateAttribution.cpp\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;searchfox.org&#x2F;mozilla-central&#x2F;source&#x2F;dom&#x2F;privateattr...</a><p>[7] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wicg.github.io&#x2F;attribution-reporting-api&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wicg.github.io&#x2F;attribution-reporting-api&#x2F;</a><p>[8] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coveryourtracks.eff.org&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coveryourtracks.eff.org&#x2F;</a>",

But saying that Chrome is better because it at least asks is disingenuous. Chrome simply presents you with the &quot;Enhanced Ad Privacy&quot; window and a button &quot;Got it&quot; or &quot;Settings&quot;. That&#x27;s clearly a dark pattern and technically not &quot;asking&quot; at all. The Topics API which you enable by clicking &quot;Got it&quot; is, at least from what I read, clearly worse than what Mozilla has implemented. Calling &quot;differential privacy&quot; a fake is simply untrue. It is not easy to implement, but if done properly, it&#x27;s absolutely not fake.<p>I agree though that Mozilla has, as usual, dropped the ball here in how they have introduced this technology. They are obviously desperate, and they know if they would ask, probably the vast majority of people would not agree. Also as usual, they will probably roll back this setting once the outcry is large enough, and they have once again lost trust and gained absolutely nothing. It&#x27;s also clear that  with the tiny market share Firefox has nowadays, thinking they could introduce a new ad technology is simply hubris.",

Something as simple and common as a summation loop can often be sped up 2-4x by simply having multiple accumulators that you then combine after the loop body; this lets the processor &quot;run ahead&quot; without loop carried dependencies and execute multiple accumulations each cycle.<p>This technique is similar in concept, but even more general. Put the &quot;guess&quot; in the registers and run with it, relying on a second instruction within a branch to correct the guess if its wrong. Assuming your guess is overwhelmingly accurate... this lets you unlock the width of modern cores in code that otherwise wouldn&#x27;t present a lot of ILP!<p>Clever.",

You can even set up fallback models for when your primary model is unavailable.<p>It&#x27;s cool to see these kinds of tools emerging because it shows that people are starting to think seriously about how to build robust, cost-effective LLM pipelines. This is going to be crucial as more and more companies start incorporating LLMs into their products and services.",

The two are not equivalent, and both should be used for important data.<p>Finding corrupt data only as you try to read it can lead to long running data corruptions, maybe to the point your backups do not go back far enough to restore the uncorrupted data. Underpinning this also is a change to RAID 0... While the fastest option, they are putting a lot of faith in that NVMe config handling that kind of workload.<p>Hope they have good backups...<p>EDIT: A good way to solve this is to spin up a temporary server, restore your backups to it, do the full data checks and when successful, you have also checked your backup and restore process along with the integrity of the file.\nYou still want to have enough overhead available to complete the RAID checks on the primary server and don&#x27;t use RAID 0 for performance.",

Because with that you get this not only in realtime, but also with only minor degradation due to the changes in the GNSS pseudo-range measurements being predictable despite not holding still.<p>Other interesting things enabled by it are e.g. auto-land of a model plane in a truck bed without needing wheels on the plane (and still preventing it from getting scratched up&#x2F;depending on a grass landing strip).<p>Even fairly good GNSS receivers aren&#x27;t expensive to build, as long as power consumption isn&#x27;t very critical, so why can&#x27;t I just buy a pair for a hundred bucks?",

Vulkan has a reputation for being difficult to work with, but if you just want to use a compute queue it&#x27;s not that horrible. Also, since Vulkan uses SPIR-V, the user would have more choices for shading languages. Additionally, with RenderDoc you get source-level shader debugging.<p>Shameless plug: in case anyone wants to see how doing just compute with Vulkan looks like, I wrote a similar library to compete on SHAllenge [0], which was posted here on HN a few days ago.

This is an elaboration of the description in TFA under the heading &quot;Use case support&quot;.<p>As is described there, Notion&#x27;s block permissions are highly normalized at the source of truth. This is usually quite efficient and generally brings along all the benefits of normalization in application databases. However, we need to _denormalize_ all the permissions that relate to a specific document when we index it into our search index.<p>When we transactionally reindex a document &quot;online&quot;, this is no problem. However, when we need to reindex an entire search cluster from scratch, loading every ancestor of each page in order to collect all of its permissions is far too expensive.<p>Thus, one of the primary needs that my team had from the new data lake is &quot;tree traversal and permission data construction for each block&quot;. We rewrote our &quot;offline&quot; reindexer to read from the data lake instead of reading from RDS instances serving database snapshots. This allowed us to dramatically reduce the impact of iterating through every page when spinning up a new cluster (not to mention save a boatload in spinning up those ad-hoc RDS instances).<p>I hope this miniature deep dive gives a little bit more color on the uses of this data store\u2014as it is emphatically _not_ to sell our users&#x27; data!",

That&#x27;s insane.<p>A change of the logging protocol to a more efficient format would yield such a huge improvement that it would be much cheaper than this infrastructure engineering exercise.<p>I suspect that everyone just assumes that the numbers represent the underling data volume, and that this cannot be decreased. Nobody seems to have heard of <i>write amplification</i>.<p>Let&#x27;s say you want to collect a metric. If you do this with a JSON document format you&#x27;d likely end up ingesting records that are like the following made-up example:<p><pre><code>    {\n      &quot;timestamp&quot;: &quot;2024-07-12T14:30:00Z&quot;,\n      &quot;serviceName&quot;: &quot;user-service-ba34sd4f14&quot;,\n      &quot;dataCentre&quot;: &quot;eastFoobar-1&quot;,\n      &quot;zone&quot;: 3,\n      &quot;cluster: &quot;stamp-prd-4123&quot;,\n      &quot;instanceId&quot;: &quot;instance-12345&quot;,\n      &quot;object&quot;: &quot;system&#x2F;foo&#x2F;blargh&quot;,\n      &quot;metric: &quot;errors&quot;,\n      &quot;units&quot;: &quot;countPerMicroCentury&quot;,\n      &quot;value&quot;: 391235.23921386\n    }\n</code></pre>\nIt wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if in reality this was actually 10x larger. For example, <i>just</i> the &quot;resource id&quot; of something in Azure is about this size, and it&#x27;s just one field of many collected by <i>every</i> logging system in that cloud for <i>every</i> record. Similarly, I&#x27;ve cracked open the protocols and schema formats for competing systems and found 300x or worse write amplification being the typical case.<p>The actual data that needed to be collected was just:<p><pre><code>    391235.23921386\n</code></pre>\nIn a binary format that would be 4 bytes, 8 if you think that you need to draw your metric graphs with a vertical precision of a millionth of a pixel and horizontal precision of a minute because you can&#x27;t afford the exabytes of storage a higher collection frequency would require.<p>If you collect 4 bytes per metric in an array and record the start timestamp and the interval, you don&#x27;t even need a timestamp per entry, just one per thousand or whatever. For a metric collected <i>every second</i> that&#x27;s just 10 MB per month <i>before</i> compression. Most metrics change slowly or not at all and would compress down to mere kilobytes.",

        "text": "Just browsing the Quickwit documentation it seems like the general architecture here is to write JSON logs but stores them compressed. Is this just something like gzip compression? 20% compressed size does seem to align to ballpark estimates of JSON GZIP compression. This is what Quickwit (and this page) calls a &quot;document&quot;: a single JSON record (just FYI).<p>Additionally you need to store indices because this is what you actually search. Indices have a storage cost when you write them too.<p>When I see a system like this my thoughts go to questions like:<p>- What happens when you alter an index configuration? Or add or remove an index?<p>- How quickly do indexes update when this happens?<p>- What about cold storage?<p>Data retention is another issue. Indexes have config for retention [1]. It&#x27;s not immediately clear to me how document retention works, possibly from S3 expiration?<p>So, network transfer from S3 is relatively expensive ($0.05&#x2F;GB standard pricing [2] to the Internet, less to AWS regions). This will be a big factor in cost. I&#x27;m really curious to know how much all of this actually costs per PB per month.<p>IME you almost never need to log and store this much data and there&#x27;s almost no reason to ever store this much. Most logs are useless and you also have to question what the purpose is of any given log. Even if you&#x27;re logging errors, you&#x27;re likely to get the exact same value out of 1% sampling of logs than you are with logging everything.<p>You might even get more value with 1% sampling because your query and monitoring might be a whole lot easier with substantially less data to deal with.<p>Likewise, metrics tend to work just as well from sampled data.<p>This post suggests 60 day log retention (100PB &#x2F; 1.6PB daily). I would probably divide this into:<p>1. Metrics storage. You can get this from logs but you&#x27;ll often find it useful to write it directly if you can. Getting it from logs can be error-prone (eg a log format changes, the sampling rate changes and so on);<p>2. Sampled data, generally for debugging. I would generally try to keep this at 10TB or less;<p>3. &quot;Offline&quot; data, which you would generally only query if you absolutely had to. This is particularly true on S3, for example, because the write costs are basically zero but the read costs are expensive.<p>Additionally, you&#x27;d want to think about data aggregation as a lot of your logs are only useful when combined in some way<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;quickwit.io&#x2F;docs&#x2F;overview&#x2F;concepts&#x2F;indexing\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;quickwit.io&#x2F;docs&#x2F;overview&#x2F;concepts&#x2F;indexing</a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aws.amazon.com&#x2F;s3&#x2F;pricing&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aws.amazon.com&#x2F;s3&#x2F;pricing&#x2F;</a>",

NX had the first &quot;intelligent user interface&quot; device. When a train enters the interlocking, the dispatcher pushes an entry button to indicate they want to dispatch that train. All the possible exit points then light up. The dispatcher then pushes the button at the appropriate exit light, and all the signals and switches are set up for that route.<p>Routing within the interlocking is automatic. Exit lights only light up if there&#x27;s an available path. The system is aware of trains in the interlocking, switches locked for maintenance, and the actual position of switches, signals, and train stop devices. As a train moves through the interlocking, track space and switches are released behind it automatically, becoming available for other trains.<p>Today this seems routine, but it was a huge breakthrough in the 1930s.\nThe original marketing brochure is available online.[2]<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bernardgreenberg.com&#x2F;Subway&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bernardgreenberg.com&#x2F;Subway&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;anyflip.com&#x2F;lbes&#x2F;vczg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;anyflip.com&#x2F;lbes&#x2F;vczg</a>",

        "text": "Railway signalling IMO is an area where a little research could <i>dramatically</i> increase the throughput of the railway network with a rather low cost.<p>Todays railways mostly use fixed block signalling.   Expensive and unreliable equipment ensures that there is only one train on each &#x27;block&#x27; of railway track at the same time.   That forces trains to be at least 1 or 2 blocks apart, which are frequently multiple miles long.  End result:   Trains are usually 10&#x27;s of minutes apart, or at least 1 minute apart even in urban subway systems.<p>A more advanced system would aim to have trains as close together as cars are on a freeway.  Trains would be able to hitch and unhitch whilst moving 100 mph, allowing different loads to be sent different directions and different sets of passengers to stop at different stations.   Crashes would be avoided by having every train know about the train ahead and behind, and unable to make any move which would cause a collision (ie. it is not allowed to slam the brakes on if there is a train right behind you).<p>Such a system would be implemented primarily on the <i>trains</i>, and primarily in <i>software</i>.   Software is expensive to develop then cheap to replicate, a property very important if you want to deploy it widely.<p>It would be backwards compatible with fixed block signalling by simply saying that within each existing fixed block there is <i>either</i> one legacy train, <i>or</i> an unlimited number of gen 2 trains who will all communicate with eachother (and any train who cannot communicate with every other train within the block is not allowed to enter the block).<p>Hardware&#x2F;software failures are kept safe by simulating every possible type of failure (ie. braking, locomotion, power, derail, position uncertainty, comms), and every second generating a plan which will be executed by every train in case of each type of failure occurring.   Any move any train wants to make where any of the above plans cannot be generated with a safe outcome isn&#x27;t allowed.",

We&#x27;re also the developers of PostgresML, so we&#x27;re big advocates of in-database machine learning. This approach eliminates the need for external services and API calls, potentially reducing latency by orders of magnitude compared to traditional microservice architectures. It&#x27;s how our founding team built and scaled the ML platform at Instacart.<p>We&#x27;re eager to get feedback from the community and welcome contributions.

Yes it&#x27;s convenient, but there are so many potential problems - what if you loose access to your account and basically won&#x27;t be able to cancel the subscription? what if company will continue to charge you even after closing your account? what if they accidently charge you for who knows what? what if you simply forget you even had a subscription?<p>I&#x27;ve had enough bad experiences with subscriptions that I avoid them at all cost, just to give an example - I subscribed to a popular streaming service because I wanted to watch a movie that was only available on their platform. I immediately canceled my subscription so it would end with current billing month, but to my surprise when I checked my credit card history several months later I&#x27;ve noticed an additional charge that was around 10x what I paid for the one month of subscription! I emailed them and they answered me that &quot;it was some kind of mistake&quot; and refunded me, but it made me realize how dangerous subscriptions are.<p>Subscriptions should be able to be paid by invoices - you receive an invoice before next billing period and if you don&#x27;t pay, account is locked, but of course that would give user too much control over their spendings and companies clearly don&#x27;t want that.",

Back when Photoshop was sold this way, support for the raw formats of new cameras that came out was gated for absolutely no reason behind buying a newer version of Photoshop. Even bugfixes would eventually only be applied to the latest version or two.<p>And what constitutes a major version requiring a paid upgrade anyway? Well that&#x27;s completely arbitrary but the company is incentivized to make that happen as often as possible.<p>Subscriptions technically mean the company can just keep updating the software. There&#x27;s only one version to support, really. There&#x27;s no incentive to gate features behind another paid update.<p>The gold standard for subscriptions is Jetbrains. Cancel anytime. When you do cancel, whatever version you had you got to keep, basically. You got warnings in your email that you would be charged in a few weeks if you didn&#x27;t cancel. The prices were reasonable. Jetbrains quite literally did everything right.<p>Then there&#x27;s Adobe. The subscription prices are pretty outrageous. No warning. Hard to cancel. Easy to get a recurring charge. Adobe, like many companies, seems to have decided that whatever the sticker price was for the standalone software, charge that every year in a subscription.<p>But before you start waxing lyrical about the halcyon days of software you &quot;own&quot;, you&#x27;ve either forgotten or never experienced the shady things software compnaies did to maximize revenue then as well.",

        "text": "&gt; For a long time the X Window System had a reputation for being difficult to configure. In retrospect, I\u2019m not 100% sure why it earned this reputation, because the configuration file format, which is plain text, has remained essentially the same since I started using Linux in the mid-1990s.<p>It&#x27;s because X&#x27;s config files were asking you questions that there was no good way of knowing the answers to other than trial-and-error. (After all, if there was some OS API already available at the time to fetch an objectively-correct answer, the X server would just use that API, and not ask you the question!)<p>An example of what I personally remember:<p>I had a PS2 mouse with three mouse-buttons and a two-axis scroll wheel (&quot;scroll nub.&quot;) How do I make this mouse work under X? Well, X has to be told what each signal the mouse can send corresponds to. And there&#x27;s no way to &quot;just check what happens&quot;, because any mouse calibration program is relying <i>on</i> the X server to talk directly to the mouse driver \u2014 there wasn&#x27;t yet any raw input-events API separate from X \u2014 so in the default X configuration that assumes a two-button mouse, none of the other buttons on the mouse get mapped to an X input event, so the mouse calibration program won&#x27;t report <i>anything</i> when you try the other parts of the mose.<p>So instead, you have to make a random guess; start X; see if the mouse works; figure out <i>by the particular way it&#x27;s wrong</i> what you should be telling X instead; quit X; edit the config file; restart X; ...etc.<p>(And now imagine this same workflow, but instead of something &quot;forgiving&quot; like your mouse not working, it&#x27;s your display; and if you set a resolution + bit-depth + refresh rate that add up to more VRAM than you have, X just locks up the computer so hard that you can&#x27;t switch back to a text console and have to reboot the whole machine.)",

They had to go on a special mousepad with a clear, slick glass or plastic surface and a special dot pattern underneath that the optosensor would use to reckon movement.

        "text": "&gt; Location History is turned off by default, so a user must take several affirmative steps before Google begins tracking and storing his Location History data.<p>Do people really think Google isn&#x27;t tracking location data without this setting enabled? How would anyone (save for a whistleblower) know? Location history seems like the data Google lets you collect&#x2F;see for yourself, and not the totality of location data (which includes data collected from nearby wifi networks, nearby cellphones, and other bluetooth devices) that google collects.<p>&gt; Even after a user opts in, he maintains some control over his location data. He can review, edit, or delete any information that Google has already obtained.<p>This is pretty misleading. You can see the location information your device sent to google, but you can&#x27;t see or delete the assumptions that google has made about you based on that data. A list of GPS coordinates showing where you frequently go on Saturday nights isn&#x27;t what people are concerned about Google having. The fact that those GPS coordinates show that you spend hours at, for example, a gay bar is more of an issue. It doesn&#x27;t matter if you delete the list of GPS coordinates from your google account because what you can&#x27;t delete is the &quot;This user is gay and often goes to gay bars on Saturdays&quot; flag that google put there the instant they got that data. No matter what you delete that data stays with Google along with the &quot;here&#x27;s how long this user stays at the gay bar, when they usually leave, where they go afterwards, and who they are with when they do&quot; flags.<p>I think what happened to this guy (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nbcnews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;us-news&#x2F;google-tracked-his-bike-ride-past-burglarized-home-made-him-n1151761\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nbcnews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;us-news&#x2F;google-tracked-his-bike...</a>) is a good indication that the entire system and the way it&#x27;s being used by police is flawed and dangerous.<p>Even worse, the situation with google is just the tip of the iceberg because it&#x27;s not just our phones that are tracking us. It&#x27;s also our cell phone companies, the random cameras and license plate&#x2F;toll transponder readers we pass by, our &quot;smart&quot; cars, etc. There&#x27;s so much tracking going on that the typically American has zero control over at all, but which police (and others) could tap into. We really need more protections against this.",

In order to make an app a trusted and regular part of my daily flow, I have to trust that it will always be there for me. This has a subscription model. That means that if the company who makes it goes away, I can&#x27;t trust that the app will still be there for me. I&#x27;d happily pay a one time fee to own it forever. But a subscription model is a deal-breaker for me.<p>Best of luck, hope there&#x27;s an ownership-based version someday, I&#x27;d love to use it.",

It sounds strange enough to get me to try it though.

I think my Macbook is pretty stock, not sure what&#x27;s causing it. I see &quot;All Notes&quot; in the main window, and a search box. So I can filter to messages that match my search. Okay, so it can do what Telegram or any chat app does - basically a chat room of just myself. I don&#x27;t see any other buttons of features to try in the window or menu.<p>I kinda see the appeal for the very narrow niche of people who want (1) a hotkey entry box and (2) enjoy taking notes as a chat log and leaving them that way.<p>I am not (2). While I do take all my notes to a chronological inbox space at first, I need to be able to quickly triage and organize it, delete things that are done&#x2F;obsolete, move things to categories and order by priority or due date. It doesn&#x27;t look like this app has any abilities like that. I do like (1) but I already have many solutions for jotting down notes fast using hotkeys and such.

It\u2019s worth emphasizing that I am interested in this because it\u2019s _simple_ and deliberately designed for this (unlike a discord message to yourself or channel or emailing notes to yourself or something).<p>That said, the single most important factor that determines whether this stays or goes for me is going to be whether it is faster&#x2F;easier at capturing information than an email (which is how I currently send myself stuff).<p>This type of thing sits at the top of my personal knowledge funnel. For a tool like this it\u2019s job (to me) is to cast as wide a net as possible and capture everything even tangentially related to whatever I happen to be doing at the snapshot in time when I decide I want to take a note, and then later if I decide that it was important after all I will go back and clean&#x2F;curate, and move the information to another system like a wiki that has a better format for long form searchable information.<p>But the critical factor for me is the ratio between work required to capture information at the top of that funnel, and the amount&#x2F;quality of information captured.<p>A classic example is recipes. If I search for baked chicken recipes, I am probably doing something like:<p>1. Search google\n2. Open 5-10 tabs\n3. Flip through them and pick one that looks good\n4. Leave them open for a few days in case the one I try doesn\u2019t end up being a keeper.\n5. If I find one I like, move it to my KB under the recipes section<p>(The same workflow happens when I am looking for movies to watch, or checking out different ways to do something for work, etc)<p>So, there would be a lot of value for me in something that could make it easier to dump those 5-10 links into a note, intuit some tags, automate some metadata, and if I don\u2019t come back to it in a few days, archive it but keep it searchable.<p>It\u2019s possible to do this with existing tools now, but that gets us back to the original point: if tool A is faster&#x2F;easier at it than tool B, tool A replaces B and becomes the incumbent.<p>All that aside, neat tool - I\u2019ll be keeping an eye on this one!",

Even in a system where people that work hardest&#x2F;smartest directly translates to the most successful - doesn&#x27;t mean you have a good system.<p>Consider an environment where a million engineers are all working on their own startups. 99% of them fail and reward the work put into them with nothing. Some subset of the remainder makes barely enough to survive; a smaller subset makes enough to have a successful business; a smaller subset makes millions, and a smaller subset makes the vast majority of the money available. If the effort put into the thing follows a mostly linear line, but the reward is exponential, is this really a good system? Do the people at the top of this structure deserve the wealth they gain, even if they genuinely the best at what they do?<p>More and more systems today are winner-take-all. Entertainment is notorious for a tiny number of multi-millionaire artists&#x2F;actors&#x2F;comedians&#x2F;etc., while the vast majority of people that try to make it end up with a succession of part-time jobs that never ends. Even if there&#x27;s no nepotism or corruption, is a system where the people at the top get everything and the bottom gets nothing a good one?<p>There&#x27;s something disturbing about PG&#x27;s take to me - as if only the most successful are deserving, or worthy - that this warped reward structure isn&#x27;t inherently unjust. It feels like the kind of justifications nobility and royalty relied on, but for modern times - &quot;I worked hard, I found the market, I did everything right, so naturally I deserve more wealth than a human can use in a thousand lifetimes.&quot;<p>So to be honest, I find almost every single one of PG&#x27;s points worthless. I don&#x27;t care how easy it is to start a startup if the chance of real money from it is one in a million. I don&#x27;t care about how much faster growth is when its billions of dollars for a few dozen people. I don&#x27;t care if the new wealth is genuinely new instead of inherited, if all we get from it is yet another tiny group of obscenely wealthy people - meet the new boss, same as the old boss. And I especially dislike the idea that the &quot;far left&quot; should be happy that &quot;labor has won&quot;. Having a system that picks a few hundred of the &quot;most worthy&quot; each year and adds them to the capital class is by no means what I could consider labor winning.",

        "text": "This article feels like an attempt to morally wash one&#x27;s hands of the moral stink of capitalism. Do you really think that because you&#x27;re in tech and not mining, that the accumulation of wealth is any less driven by exploitation?<p>By the way, I don&#x27;t know the answer to this. I myself am a landlord. But if we&#x27;re getting into morality, let&#x27;s fully examine this.<p>11.5% of Americans are below the poverty line. The same economic system that makes is possible to become rich enforces a roughly 5% unemployment rate. This unemployment rate is necessary to prevent a wage price spiral. There are people who are paid a lot of money (Federal Reserve),  whose job it is to pull levers and turn dials until the unemployment rate is at that magic 5%. They actively ensure people can&#x27;t make a living, to allow you the chance to accumulate wealth.<p>You may not be directly responsible for their poverty\u2013 but their poverty makes your accumulation of wealth possible. Without a 5% unemployment rate, the delicate balance of the economy cascades into oblivion in a wage-price spiral.<p>So here&#x27;s my moral question\u2013 do you then owe them anything? Do you owe society anything?<p>Maybe there is something wrong with &quot;just being rich&quot; if you don&#x27;t attempt to use some of your money for the betterment of your community and society that is actively made worse to allow you to get rich.<p>If you want to get rich, get rich. But don&#x27;t fool yourself into thinking that it&#x27;s morally good. It can be, but it&#x27;s probably not. Because it&#x27;s probably at the expense of others in some direct or indirect way.<p>By the way I&#x27;m pulling punches here. This is a very gentle response to try and get you to think differently about your ethics.<p>---<p>If you&#x27;re the sort of person that always needs to feel morally right, then I would say getting rich probably isn&#x27;t for you. Any moral argument you can come up to protect your ego would be fragile, and easily undone.",

It&#x27;s the 30%.<p>At first the &quot;tax on billionaire&quot; was supposed to be that: a tax on billionaires. But then there are already publications explaining how &quot;taxing anyone who has more than a million (a million, not a billion) would bring x in revenue for the various countries&quot;.<p>Also note that it&#x27;s never about distributing that money to the poor: it&#x27;s always about the state getting more money. Money which is then spent in state-friendly companies.<p>For example the EU is hard at work now imposing a mandatory, EU-wide, tax on all its citizens to &quot;finance EU projects&quot;. It&#x27;s not a tax to give money to poor people. It&#x27;s a tax to give money to companies like Thales and Airbus and a shitload of sycophantic companies that&#x27;d be bankrupt if not for the state&#x27; intervention.<p>Just look at how government are managing the insane money they get: do you think they&#x27;re doing a good job when they&#x27;re at, say, 130% debt-to-GDP ratio? Why would I want to encourage such irresponsible spenders by giving them even more?<p>When a country like France, which is badly in debt and has huge deficits, has about 60% of its GDP that is tied to public spending, it&#x27;s not the fault of &quot;the rich&quot; if the country is not doing well. It&#x27;s the fault of the people governing that country.<p>So, no, thanks but no thanks. I don&#x27;t want any &quot;let&#x27;s tax the rich&quot; discourse because I know that it&#x27;s the middle-class, not the rich, that&#x27;s going to end up getting owned.<p>Just like fighting the four horsemen of the infocalypse is an excuse used by the states to gain every more power, attacking the rich is an excuse for the state to gain ever more power.

        "text": "Could the gallium anomaly be explained by something far more prosaic? For example, in water, there are all kinds of species of different anions and cations present, existing in equilibrium with each other. Water forms complex semi-crystalline structures by virtue of hydrogen bonds. Although they are not true crystals, the supramolecular structures of individual water molecules and the valence species create a sophisticated structure, even in a seemingly homogenous substance.<p>Now, consider if something similar happens with gallium. What if the electron configuration of gallium&#x27;s orbitals means that gallium, in its liquid form, also has various anions and cations? Moreover, what if gallium can form analogs to hydrogen bonds, leading to semi-crystalline or structured forms?<p>This structured form could provide some shielding to the gallium atoms, making them less likely to be converted via neutrinos to germanium. Instead of impacting a nucleus at the expected rate, the overlapping orbital bonds and electron resonance might offer a form of shielding. This shielding could make the gallium atoms more stable and less reactive, thereby reducing their conversion to germanium.<p>While this idea applies a chemical concept to nuclear chemistry or physics, and may not align perfectly with the traditional views of high-energy particle physicists and astronomers, it offers a potentially more prosaic explanation for the gallium anomaly. This perspective might not have been top of mind for those focused on high-energy interactions and could be worth considering further.",

This is not particular to any topic; it&#x27;s an optimization problem: we&#x27;re trying to optimize the site for intellectual curiosity [2].<p>The trouble with reflexive comments is that they repeat responses that have already happened many times\u2014rather as if they&#x27;re being served from cache [3].

        "text": "This is such a difficult topic. When I started my undergraduate in CompSci, the department of 300 students had exactly 3 women. The faculty had way more female instructors than it did students. The Commucation Sciences department, which was on the same campus, had the inverse student population.<p>I&#x27;m all in favour for letting students making their own study (and career) choices, but when the imbalance is this great, I can&#x27;t but help think that valuable perspectives are lost. And that&#x27;s just looking at the sexes, that doesn&#x27;t even take into account what could be gained from interacting with folks with different socio-economic backgrounds, who were equally underrepresented.<p>Trying to keep barriers for entry low seems worth while. Organizations which help people break into non-traditional fields (for their background&#x2F;sex&#x2F;whatever) also seem to be worth while. Funding them seems like a no brainer. This isn&#x27;t limited to girls in tech. Also boys in nursing, poor kids in law school, brown kids in politics, whatever.",

Minimally, Universal Activator Networks include gene regulatory networks, cell networks, neural networks, cooperative social networks, and sufficiently advanced artificial neural networks.<p>Evolvability and generative open-endedness define Universal Activation Networks, setting them apart from other dynamic networks, complex systems or replicators.

There would have to be an easier way to see what changed where quickly without having to mess up my working tree (which is almost always dirty with something) and having to stash or switch back and forth between branches for reviewing is going to be painful. Sometimes I have small comments or questions, I&#x27;d like to be able to do that without having to download the entire patch.<p>Also, I&#x27;m not sure if I missed something, but does every review get applied as a commit by itself that I (as repo owner) would have to squash? This feels like a chore by itself.<p>I have relied on github for previous work but for the last couple of years I&#x27;ve been primarily using Gerrit for my job, and although there are some drawbacks, I absolutely love its workflow. Github workflow is not free from drawbacks either, and if I&#x27;m asked now I absolutely prefer Gerrit&#x27;s to Github&#x27;s. Gerrit uses Git references in a unique way to facilitate code reviews and patches (which consist of one or more patchsets). I rarely use branches now except for extremely long-lived experiments, or for local temp purposes. A patch gets merged as a single commit no matter how many rounds of patchsets the submitter adds and reviews they get, and when needed I can quickly download the patch at any patchset to a different branch and then delete it.",

But the SSH workflow replaces them with similar issues such as (1) setting SSH server and maintaining it and the cost associated with it, (2) clients will need to maintain their identities though SSH, (4) replace email-replies with code comments (email-replies is better as you can do more than just text). (3) Here SSH workflow is better as it requires no work, but configuring git-send is a very small and usually 1-time change.<p>In most cases, the only mail client requirement is to be able to write plain text. Virtually all mail clients can do this with a simple checkbox. Only the maintainer will need ability to `git am&#x27; the patch from an email message, and this is indeed a downside of email workflow.<p>All in all, nothing wrong with more options, and I am sure SSH meets certain needs, but to me email-workflow and SSH compete in the same category and email-workflow is superior.",

        "text": "This looks kind of small and homely and is obviously designed to appeal to a certain niche, which is nice. But the problem with a lot of &quot;alternative code hosting&quot; tools like this, IMO, is that they aren&#x27;t actually that good for code review. This really dulls their appeal. What&#x27;s the point of setting all this up if I don&#x27;t read the patches?<p>If you are only accepting 1 patch a year, then the reality is anything will work. Email, uploading .patch files to a bug tracker, GitHub, whatever. But if you&#x27;re doing review and managing a dozen active patch sets at once with people who are asynchronous to you, then you need something better than that. Let&#x27;s say 5-10 active contributors. That&#x27;s where projects actually tend to struggle.<p>There&#x27;s this book called &quot;Rethinking UI&quot; and one of the first things it talks about is to write down features for your system, because the user interface <i>comes from</i> features. You can&#x27;t design the UI without laying out a list of features. What features do <i>I</i> need in a code review tool? The two most important ones IMO are:<p>1. Code review is iterative, so a good feature is being able to see the history of a change as it is iterated on.<p>2. It&#x27;s normal to have many patches in flight (your own + others). So, it&#x27;s very useful to be able to quickly find things in a particular state: you need to review it (patch from someone else), you need to update it (patch you wrote and that got reviewed), it needs to be merged.<p>Extra:<p>3. It should be easy to safely integrate a change when it&#x27;s ready.<p>Most tools are very bad at these core ideas:<p>- Almost no actual mainstream review tools, or modern pop-up clones, ever include &quot;git range-diff&quot; in their repertoire of tools. range-diff is essential for many projects to do iterative review, and tools like Linux&#x27;s b4 automate them. I won&#x27;t include it all here, but I wrote about this review style elsewhere: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;thoughtpolice&#x2F;9c45287550a56b2047c6311fbadebed2\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;thoughtpolice&#x2F;9c45287550a56b2047c631...</a><p>- Most tools fall apart at &quot;What state is this in.&quot; For instance, in GitHub it&#x27;s impossible to tell what state anything is in, except &quot;Can be merged&quot; or &quot;Cannot be merged.&quot; For instance, do I need to do another review on this PR after I did one before, and a coworker did one too? I have to go and look to see if everything was addressed properly. Tools like Gerrit have a more granular concept called &quot;The Attention Set&quot; which formalizes the concept of &quot;Do I need to do something?&quot; because it shows you when <i>you</i> need to take an action, like re-review or merge a patch.<p>git-pr doesn&#x27;t really seem to make those core problems any easier.<p>Your approach sort of sidesteps these, these because you&#x27;re expected to apply code manually and view it in your own editor. You could range-diff on your own. Part of the argument here goes back to the argument that best thing to do is sit in your editor -- but with a good review tool, you can do lots of review purely from your tool with no editor involved! I did <i>tons</i> of code review with Gerrit every day without ever opening my editor for 99% of it.<p>A semi-related thing some people say is &quot;Well, in the Linux kernel style you can just send a pull request through any medium&quot;, while GitHub and these other tools use a specific interface. The problem is you still need state to track the state of the work. That&#x27;s required (it&#x27;s one of my features!), notably so you can look at the change evolution and see if it&#x27;s ready to merge. If I tell you &quot;Please merge my branch from <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;example.com&#x2F;foo.git\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;example.com&#x2F;foo.git</a> with tag xyz-123&quot; that&#x27;s technically a &quot;pull request&quot; like you would send to Linus, but understanding the actual state that PR is in is impossible without a lot of extra knowledge that a third party tool formalizes (even if poorly.) b4, the Linux kernel patch series tool, has a ton of stuff for things like this like digging up the right email threads to do diffs between, showing the cover letter, etc.<p>And in the &quot;How do Patch Requests work?&quot; section, this sort of shows exactly the problem with this approach. I don&#x27;t want to manually apply patches and run commands to merge it and push manually! I have 10 other patches to read after this one! Integrating things is why my tool is there! Why are steps 13 and 14 even necessary, for instance?<p>Gerrit does all 3 of the above properly and is a very, very powerful and productive tool when you get used to it.<p>Your approach does have a conceptual advantage which is that it focuses on the <i>patch</i> and not the &quot;branch&quot; as the unit of work. This is smart. So, if you keep going down this road and follow it to its logical conclusion, I think you&#x27;ll tread some familiar ground. But I think realistically, you need to track actual state a patch is in, so that you can do things like range-diff it -- that would make the appeal of &quot;Just write comments in the code&quot; or whatever much higher because at least you can see when those comments get handled. You&#x27;ll want to think about concepts like &quot;Change IDs&quot; as Gerrit calls them. Etc.<p>BTW, Gerrit does all if this, it uses this &#x27;Git notes&#x27; approach you briefly mention, and it stores all its content in a Git repo too, no extra database. The web UI has tons of affordances, and everything you do in the web UI is just a commit in the underlying repo. And you can interact with Gerrit entirely over SSH with pubkeys if you want; it looks like running normal commands e.g. `ssh austin@gerrit.foo.com gerrit review ...` -- in theory you could write a whole TUI. I strongly suggest spending some time with it, if you haven&#x27;t.",

There is no substantial datasets on the internet or github, and no documentation except the one provided. And that&#x27;s all the model should need.<p>I asked GPT-4 to write a mat mul function, but that was too ambitious and it spit out outrageous nonsense.<p>To be more fair, I gave it in-context access to the documentation in prompt, along with the fibonacci example function; aka everything humans have access to. I then asked it to do the simpler task of converting a base 10 integer to binary. It was unable to write something error free even after 4 rounds of supplying it the error messages.<p>I repeated this 5 times in case it generates something grammatical in the Top-K@5.<p>I suspected there was some confusion it couldn&#x27;t surmount about string manipulation. So I changed the question to something challenging, yet something that only used function calls, conditional logic, basic math ops, and numbers. First, I asked for an nth root approximator using newton&#x27;s method. Didn&#x27;t work. Asked for just the square root. Didn&#x27;t work. Finally, I asked for a function that prints a student&#x27;s grade given their integer percentage. Not even.<p>GPT-4 also persistently hallucinated the keyword BREAKING NEWS, which I think sounds like a pretty good keyword if Tabloid were to ever get error handling.<p>The spooky part is that the almost all the solutions at face value would get partial credit. They had the right abstract approach, being familiar with reams of example approaches in natural language or programming languages. However, in each case, GPT-4, 4o, Claude all failed to produce something without syntax errors.<p>I suspect this is the case because transformers do subgraph matching, and while on one end there are rich internal connections for all the problems I requested, on the other end there is nothing similar enough for it to even get a foothold, hence the biggest struggle being syntax. If the only barrier to executing Tabloid code (or other unseen languages) is more basic syntax training, then it excitingly suggests it just needs to learn the abstract concepts from leetcode scrapes once for every syntax it knows. Prior research has shown that grammar is easy for language models. When GPT-2 was made large enough, it went from babbling to grammatical sentences very early in it&#x27;s training, and at that moment its loss plummeted.<p>All tests conducted in temporary data mode so that this eval stays dark.",

After all, it does feel a bit like tracking...

Are they doing it properly? Do they have the correct incentives to keep doing it properly in the long term? Can advertisers just undermine it by giving everyone&#x27;s ads a different ID? Also, your threat model may include that this aggregator company is hacked, or that the government secretly forces it to share the data with them.<p>Nevertheless, I think that Mozilla probably genuinely think this is better for privacy.

So nodes in the network do not know what data they are routing and the advertisers get aggregated data without knowing who the users were:<p><pre><code>    ... our DAP service, which is a Multiparty\n    Compute (MPC) system based on Prio ...\n</code></pre>\nAnd the &quot;Multiparty&quot; seems to be these two:<p><pre><code>    Our DAP deployment is jointly run by\n    Mozilla and ISRG.

It&#x27;s my daily drive for browser for basically everything, and 99% of the time, even on stuff that you would think wouldn&#x27;t work, it works just fine. I keep chromium in my back pocket just in case, but I&#x27;ve only had to pull chromium out like twice in the past year, once for something that required the USB-HID protocol and once for iCloud.<p>And yes, for those of you on distributions, you might say that your distribution maintainers will just patch out or customize out, and the nefarious changes that Mozilla makes upstream. But the thing you have to remember is that distribution maintainers are handling, by a whole lot of other things, tens of thousands of other packages, and an entire operating system, and its upkeep, go through them. So they will often just not patch out or patch things out inconsistently or not really pay attention. I think it&#x27;s much better to rely on a project whose whole purpose and explicit mission is making Mozilla more privacy-friendly and secure and who have a dedicated community of a few developers consistently working on it. Especially since distribution maintainers don&#x27;t really make any specific mission statement promises with regards to specific packages, but something like LW does. It does a lot more than just this one thing. It&#x27;s essentially equivalent to having a arkenfox config maintained for you and always applied to your browser and updated in lockstep with your browser, as well as a set of patches that they maintain to remove things like Pocket.",

Back when I wrote programs in assembly I would use printout to keep track of what I was doing and for debugging, and so would often put a finger on the paper to mark where a jump was and then go to the destination to see if it matched up, etc.  This process isn&#x27;t at all scalable, so the compiler is inevitably going to do better than I ever could on anything more than something trivial.<p>2 - I know more about the program constraints than I could ever express (much less be bothered expressing) in a HLL.  &quot;All the values will be less than 16&quot; or &quot;I can use this memory location for something else after I&#x27;ve read from it&quot; or who knows what.  So sometimes I can chop stuff out or even rewrite the compiler output locally to speed it up.<p>Also I can only do this for a few architectures...and with modern x86 there are so many variants with all sorts of microoptimization affordances that I can rarely beat the compiler (this is a corollary of lemma 1)",

        "text": "<i>&gt; The dispatch loop takes a single indirect branch to the opcode-specific implementation. This means that the branch will be nigh unpredictable!</i><p>Modern branch predictors can actually predict indirect branches with multiple destinations, because they hash recent branch history into the prediction. The exact same indirect branch will end up with multiple BTB entries, based on previous control flow.<p>I was curious where the threaded code speedup is actually coming from. It&#x27;s possible much of the speedup is coming from eliminating the extra branch back to the dispatch loop. Or maybe the history tracking in the M1&#x27;s branch predictor doesn&#x27;t work well for this type of control flow.<p>So I checked out this code and modified the next macro, adding a dummy branch over a nop, to roughly isolate this factor.<p>On my M1, the extra unconditional branch benchmarks at 1.08 sec for fib, and 1.19 sec for Mandelbrot (all other times were the same).<p>Looks like the speedup is a mixture of the two. Eliminating that extra branch is responsible for about 20-30% of the speedup, and improving prediction on indirect branches is responsible for the other 70-80%",

Compilers lack the ability to consistently perform many basic optimizations to an embarrassing extent. Including even the ones you would think would be the first optimizations you&#x27;d implement when writing a compiler. Open up Godbolt and tell me if you still think the compiler knows best. I try to submit at least one issue to LLVM every time I look at the assembly it gives me. I say &quot;try to&quot; because sometimes it&#x27;s too much to deal with.<p>And by the way, probably the absolute worst things the compiler does are the &quot;smart&quot; things. I write my code knowing what the emit should look like, and the compiler sometimes thinks it has a better idea than how I wrote the code and makes the emit a lot more convoluted and slower than it would be if it just did what I said. Actually, I do know the machine decently well, thank you.<p>Saying &quot;centuries of engineering&quot; is misleading. A lot of those centuries are people arguing about theoretical optimizations of dubious value while we still haven&#x27;t even finished on the most basic optimizations that are obviously beneficial.<p>The second paragraph making it sound all mysterious that compilers are even more awful at interpreters than normal code really speaks to a complete lack of exposure to the subject matter. This stuff is only esoteric because you couldn&#x27;t be bothered to look at godbolt.org. Which is totally fine by the way, just don&#x27;t go telling me how high quality compilers are if you&#x27;ve never even looked.<p>That would be like me telling web developers that Dreamweaver produces phenomenal HTML and CSS, without ever looking at what it emits.<p>Sorry for the rant but it just bothers me how much praise is heaped upon compilers like they are some kind of gift from God, forged by monks, wizards, and unrivaled geniuses.

In my opinion the problem is exactly the same as for every other high-level service they&#x27;ve tried to launch. QuickSight, Lex, Polly, Cognito, CodeGuru, SageMaker, etc: they&#x27;re not good. Nobody ever said &quot;I really like QuickSight, I sure wish it had GenAI capabilities&quot;. So when the hastily-expanded QuickSight team(s) then goes on to release 42 different Q enabled SKUs, nobody cares. For various reasons, AWS is organizationally incapable of launching a non-infrastructure product that is simply great, as doing so would take attention to detail and deeply caring about things like UX which are anathema to Amazon.<p>On the positive side, GenAI model access will be commoditized and part of the basic undifferentiated cloud infra, and AWS will do fine there.",

Similar performance problems also plague related techniques like trace-based JITs, even though the trace JIT happens at runtime and thus has access to strictly more information about the frequency with which a trace might be used.<p>You can try to use annotations like the @extract proposed in the article to control these problems, but it can be hard to predict in advance when this is going to occur.<p>One interesting research direction might be to use deep reinforcement learning to try to guide the generalization&#x2F;termination decisions, where the reward is based on A) whether the unfolding leads to a tie-back later on, and B) to what extent the unfolding allowed deforestation&#x2F;beta reduction to take place.",

Dashboard provided grid-based summary over individual weeks, months, and years. It also provided configurable line graphs and pie charts for various sales metrics. Data pre-processing done with Sci-Kit. Later added sales prediction using Machine Learning.<p>Job 2 (applying for Data Analysis) - Analyzed raw daily sales data to determine data cleansing needed, and created tool pipeline using Python NumPy, SciKit, and scikit-learn. Integrated pipeline into Riak data source ingest, and then built sales dashboard web site to visualize the data. Provided ML model for sales prediction built with scikit-learn, with XX parameters. Model achieved YY accuracy with only a ZZ mean error.<p>Same work in both, but I highlight the tasks most relevant to the target job.<p>Other thoughts are that Latex is a good way to get a well laid out PDF resume (PDF is not the web, you should have two versions of your resume), and I agree with other commenters - the final product needs more polish if it was actually going to be used to produce a resume to send in (I think it&#x27;s fine as a proof of concept though).",

It\u2019s interesting that sourcers and recruiters make most of the decisions about who gets to the interview stage (particularly in a down market), yet they are the least qualified to assess the capabilities of the candidate of everyone in the whole process. Despite that, their assessment of a candidate\u2019s resume has an outsized influence on the candidate\u2019s outcome.<p>When you have 1,000 resumes from laid off software engineers from FANG companies that all look mostly the same, how do you decide who to call?<p>I\u2019ve been thinking lately that an interesting project might be to look for publicly available resumes of people who have recently accepted new jobs within the tech industry and compare their resumes against those of people who have been looking for a new job for a while. The comparison would be qualitative if only a few resumes are available or perhaps quantitative (i.e., a classification model) if many are available.<p>Recruiters are not looking for the same signals as hiring managers, and since I\u2019m not a recruiter, I would really like to know exactly what it is that they <i>are</i> looking for.<p>As an example of this kind of discrepancy that caught me totally off-guard, I was slightly below the \u201cyears of experience\u201d requirement on a particular job posting that seemed to match my background perfectly. The recruiter I was talking to had reached out about another job posting where I did meet the YoE requirement, but I said the other posting was a significantly better fit for my skills and experience. The recruiter replied that the YoE requirement was not negotiable, so I was put onto the interview loop for the much less applicable role because of this arbitrary and narrowly missed line in the sand (and of course I failed that interview, wasting both my time and theirs).<p>A hiring manager would care less about years in seat and more about capability. That such a YoE requirement might be used as a hard filter when scanning resumes caught me by surprise\u2014I had previously sent out plenty of resumes where I narrowly missed the YoE requirement, and in retrospect, my application was probably discarded immediately while using up the \u201cquota\u201d of how many times I could apply to that company. These sorts of insights from the recruiting world would be great to know in advance from the candidate\u2019s perspective.",

This does you no good, it hurts you.<p>Example glitches:<p>The contact row dropping LinkedIn to next line.  The ragged bullets hanging to the left of the left margin relative to headlines.  The dates not right aligned. The too-large font making it take ALL of two pages for just a decade.<p>These things do get judged at a glance when someone&#x27;s looking at lots of PDFs.<p>Also, just because a resume goes into an ATS doesn&#x27;t mean the hiring manager isn&#x27;t looking at the original PDF.  <i>Usually</i> the ATS surfaces&#x2F;sorts applicants but one reads the original PDF or Word doc anyway, because the ATS interpretation is often unreliable on its own.<p>All that said...<p>One idea to counter the above advice is either in italics under the contact line or in a clear footer, put a colophon or imprint saying:  This PDF was auto-generated from my job history data, blogged about the automation here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;full.web.link&#x2F;resume-blog-post\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;full.web.link&#x2F;resume-blog-post</a><p>But still, exhibit a higher bar for the end product.  Engineers that fall in love with over-engineering without regard for the output and &quot;end user experience&quot; are everywhere, and a problem.  Engineers that produce above-the-bar output end users appreciate, while <i>ironically</i> over-engineering, with full tongue in cheek recognition of the over-engineering, are rare.",

(I\u2019ve never personally tried setting up a nontrivial namespace setup.)<p>Has anyone set up Talos in a useful way on a server with a single disk or a single RAID array?",

I work at Sidero (creators of Talos) and there are lots of \u201csecure, immutable, and minimal\u201d Linux distos out there.<p>Something that Talos does differently is everything is an API. Machine configuration, upgrades, debugging\u2026it\u2019s all APIs. This helps with maintaining systems way beyond the usual cloud-init and systemd wrappers in other \u201cminimal\u201d distros.<p>The second big change is Talos Linux is only designed for Kubernetes. It\u2019s not a generic Linux kernel+container runtime. The init system was designed to run the kubelet and publish an API that feels like a Kubernetes native component.<p>This drastically reduces the Linux knowledge required to run, scale, and maintain a complex system like Kubernetes.<p>I\u2019ve been doing a set of live streams called Talos Linux install fest walking new users through setting up their first cluster on Talos. Each install is in a new environment so please check it out.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;siderolabs&#x2F;streams\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;siderolabs&#x2F;streams</a>",

It&#x27;s a bunch of Ansible script and it allows to make any custom setup, like absolutely anything as you in control of the machines. But the other side of this is that it&#x27;s extremely easy to break everything. Which we did a couple of times. And so any upgrade is a risk of loosing the whole cluster, so we decided it must be run in VM with full backup before each upgrade. Another problem that it takes about an hour to apply a change, because Ansible has to apply all the scripts each time.<p>Then we migrated to Talos, and it&#x27;s a day and night. The initial setup took like an hour, including reading the docs and a tutorial. Easy to setup, easy to maintain, easy to upgrade (and it takes minutes). Note that we run the nodes as VMs in Proxmox, so the disk and network setup are outside of Talos scope, as well as backups, and it&#x27;s actually simplifies everything. So it &quot;just works&quot; and we can focus on your app not the cluster setup.",

Why leave the possibility of escape open?<p>Well see, the Minotaur was arbitrarily strong.

But, he wouldn&#x27;t try and break down anything if there was obviously a path right there he could use to go around it normally.

It wasn&#x27;t very large, maybe 150 foot square, 8 foot tall plywood sheets, so you couldn&#x27;t just climb out. At the center of the maze was a ladder you would climb up to a platform where you could see the whole maze except the part under the 20 foot square platform you were standing on. And that was the tricky part. It seemed that when you went through the center part of the maze you would end up in an unexpected part of the maze, and even though we could see the maze from above, none of it made any sense to how we might get out.

No glue is needed and I have saved a fair amount of cash by using their printer instead of buying one.<p>Home versions of these printer+cutters start at around 300-400 bucks.

        "text": "It&#x27;s not very clear to me why in paragraph &quot;Truncation matters&quot; it is claimed that the strlen variant is necessarily better than the strlcpy variant. the strlcpy variant only scan the source and destination string once in the fast case (no reallocation needed), while the strlen variant needs to scan the source string at least twice. I guess in the common case you have to enlarge the destination a few times, then once it&#x27;s big enough you don&#x27;t have to enlarge it anymore and always hit the fast case, os it makes sense to optimize for that.<p>It might also be that in some programs with different access patterns that doesn&#x27;t happen and it makes sense to optimize for the slow case, sure, but the author should acknowledge that variability instead of being adamant on what&#x27;s better, even to the point of calling &quot;schizo&quot; the solution it doesn&#x27;t understand. In my experience the pattern of optimizing the fast path makes a lot of sense.<p>BTW, the strlcpy&#x2F;&quot;schizo&quot; variant could stand some improvement: realloc() already copies the part of the string within the original size of the buffer, so you can start copying at that point. Also, once you know that the destination is big enough to receive a full copy of the source you can use good old strcpy(). Cargo cult and random &quot;linters&quot;&#x2F;&quot;static checkers&quot; will tell you shouldn&#x27;t, but you know that it&#x27;s a perfectly fine function to call once you&#x27;ve ensured that its prerequisites are satisfied.",

I just received and installed the new AT&amp;T router&#x2F;fiber modem, and ... the Internet speed is just as slow as before. I pay for 1 Gbps symmetric, and I&#x27;m getting 8 Mbps down and 6 Mbps up. On 6&#x2F;28, the average connection speed went from 1 Gbps down to 100 Mbps. On 7&#x2F;8 the average speed went from 100 Mbps to 8 Mbps. This is all measured both on the device at the fiber, and through a separate monitor I have wired into the 1 Gbps network.<p>I would recommend &quot;slow internet&quot;.<p>Also saying &quot;Slow internet, not slow wifi&quot; is probably causing the bot to believe you&#x27;re asking about wifi specifically because it&#x27;s not an &quot;AI&quot; bot in the trendy sense of the word and it just sees the word wifi.",

        "text": "I think support is going to get worse before it gets better.<p>From a quick glance the chatbot described in this post it is clearly moving through a dialog tree and not LLM based. The outsourced support agent is likely also just moving through some sort of script. I don&#x27;t think the chatbot necessarily made the experience much worse than typical AT&amp;T support.<p>I think the big challenge with promise of AI chatbots (not in this example though), is that somehow you can just replace your entire support team with a bunch of bots, and free up your reactive support team to do other things.  We (Olark: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.olark.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.olark.com</a>) have definitely seen this in our customer base and try really hard to walk people back from this perspective, but even then we are going to see more and more unstaffed chat solutions (e.g. every drift bot ever, and most intercoms) before things swing back to some hybrid of AI and humans.<p>That said, a very simplified version of the way I think about how AI chatbots and what the future of support looks like might help you:<p>1) Big enterprises (or regional monopolies) who are mostly monopolies selling to consumers, where they have to just be good enough that regulators don&#x27;t come after them (or sometimes compete on price (AT&amp;T, Comcast&#x2F;Xfinity, Verizon, power company)), these folks will always offer the cheapest support they can get away with.<p>2) Companies that still win business with human relationships. These folks will likely over index on AI and provide worse service if they BELIEVE that they are winning business based on some sort of non-relationship based factors.<p>3) Small businesses with small teams wearing multiple hats all the time, where providing AI support lets them offer a better service than they&#x27;d be able to provide (e.g. we now can answer 50% of questions 24&#x2F;7 instantly).  They will over index on AI until it hurts the bottom line.<p>I still believe human relationships matter, and figuring out how to create hybrid bot &#x2F; human customer service to enable humans to do their best work is still huge unsolved opportunity.",

Companies who have previously had local call centres with 1000s (or more) staff were gradually being moved to cheaper locations, not just to save cost, but also to save massive pension and benefits liabilities. Once all these people have gone service drops off dramatically, but then even the offshore people are being phased out.

Of course the average HN commenter would (claim to) have a nuanced situation that can only be handled by a human representative, but the majority of customer service interactions can be handled much more routinely.<p>Bits About Money [2] has a thoughtful take on customer support tiers from the perspective of banking:<p>&gt; Think of the person from your grade school classes who had the most difficulty at everything. The U.S. expects banks to service people much, much less intelligent than them. Some customers do not understand why a $45 charge and a $32 charge would overdraw an account with $70 in it. The bank will not be more effective at educating them on this than the public school system was given a budget of $100,000 and 12 years to try. This customer calls the bank much more frequently than you do. You can understand why, right? From their perspective, they were just going about their life, doing nothing wrong, and then for some bullshit reason the bank charged them $35.<p>It&#x27;s frustrating to be put through a gauntlet of chatbots and phone menus when you absolutely know you need a human to help, but that&#x27;s the economics of chatbots and tier 1&#x2F;2 support versus specialists:<p>&gt; The reason you have to \u201cjump through hoops\u201d to \u201csimply talk to someone\u201d (a professional, with meaningful decisionmaking authority) is because the system is set up to a) try to dissuade that guy from speaking to someone whose time is expensive and b) believes, on the basis of voluminous evidence, that you are likely that guy until proven otherwise.<p>Yes, I agree that when I absolutely need to speak to a human, it&#x27;s infuriating to no end. But everyone&#x27;s collective &quot;absolutely need to speak to a human&quot; bar is higher than it may need to be.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=38681450\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=38681450</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bitsaboutmoney.com&#x2F;archive&#x2F;seeing-like-a-bank&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bitsaboutmoney.com&#x2F;archive&#x2F;seeing-like-a-bank&#x2F;</a>",

Maybe it is inevitable that successful systems turn into big balls of mud eventually once the &quot;inflection&quot; point has been reached and (slow) deterioration begins.<p>It is somewhat of a clich\u00e8 but I think that (interactive) documentation and tooling can make a difference, but it is very difficult to design the process and the tooling to be as frictionless as possible. Tudor Girba and his team at feenk have been doing a lot of interesting work in that area that&#x27;s worth a look [1, 2].<p>The software in question might be an entangled mess, a large part of it might be even inherent due to its requirements or technical constraints, but if that messy web can be readily augmented with background information and sign-posts I think the situation could be significantly improved.<p>On a related note, there has been a project at Xerox PARC called PIE (Personal Information Environment) [3] which has put forward the idea of organizing software and its artifacts (source code, various kinds of documentation) as a network. Although that particular concept has never been adopted in any major programming system as far as I know, I think that it has huge potential, especially if the software, as a network, can be collaboratively navigated and extended with additional information, where and when needed -- online.<p>Now that all does not change the fact that we are still dealing with a ball (or a web) of mud, but at least it is accessible and we might have a better chance to understand its evolution and the reasons that made it complicated in the first place.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;feenk.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;feenk.com&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gtoolkit.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gtoolkit.com&#x2F;</a><p>[3] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bitsavers.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;xerox&#x2F;parc&#x2F;techReports&#x2F;CSL-81-3_An_Experimental_Description-Based_Programming_Environment.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bitsavers.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;xerox&#x2F;parc&#x2F;techReports&#x2F;CSL-81-3...</a>",

Lots of different predesigned parts, cool, cool.<p>But it&#x27;s axe grinding time.<p>As I recall from digging into STEMFIE a while ago (because I can&#x27;t find this information on the site), they use some odd base unit like 12.5mm, which I assume is chosen because it&#x27;s approximately half an inch (12.7mm), but &quot;more metric&quot;.  Which as far as unit systems goes, gives you the worst of both worlds, in that it will almost, but not quite, fit with your 1&#x2F;2-inch based construction systems (like Erector Set&#x2F;Meccano beams), and the metric numbers end up being not all that nice anyway (if you subdivide a beam in half or thirds you up with 6.25 or 4.167mm), so you may as well have picked exact compatibility with an existing system, anyway.<p>I wish people were less afraid to use &quot;half an inch&quot; as their base unit, if that&#x27;s the size they want.  It&#x27;s as if they hear &#x27;metric is superior&#x27; in grade school and think that means that real-world objects that happen to be designed around something other multiples of 10 of some metric unit are yucky and they&#x27;d better adjust it slightly so nobody notices, even if that means throwing out compatibility with a lot of existing stuff.<p>Okay rant over.",

Consider the ergonomics of forwarding an error type multiple layers in a Rust program: you can remove some of the boilerplate by strapping macros on top, but I&#x27;d argue that&#x27;s more of a bandage than a fix. Most other programming languages are either using exceptions, which I don&#x27;t like as they complicate control flow behavior significantly, or simply ignore error <i>handling</i> entirely (like C and Go; Both of them provide some standard facilities for dealing with error <i>values</i>, but handling it is completely manual. I do like this, since it&#x27;s very straightforward, but it nonetheless is just sidestepping the problem.) And even trying to keep it simple can create new problems, like of course the way pthreads has to contort errno into a thread-local, for reasons obvious.<p>And while stderr has created a somewhat unified channel for dumping errors <i>into</i>, once they&#x27;ve bubbled up to the point where the program needs to output it, there&#x27;s an almost unlimited amount of opinions on exactly how error logging should work. Some software won&#x27;t use stderr by default, others only uses stderr for specific types of errors. Some software dumps <i>everything</i> that isn&#x27;t data output into stderr, including e.g. `--help` text, whereas some software uses stdout for anything that isn&#x27;t explicitly an error (Which often leads to me needing to pipe --help to less twice: once without, and once with 2&gt;&amp;1.) Categorization of error logging is also somewhat contentious: should there be a &quot;warning&quot; severity? should you split errors into modules? Formatting, too: what should be in a log line? Should logs be structured into a machine-readable format such as JSON?<p>It was probably a bad omen that even very old versions of UNIX ran into problems dealing with error logging and wound up needing to bifurcate things. Few programs feel as &#x27;lazy&#x27; as UNIX; if UNIX couldn&#x27;t ignore the problem, god knows the rest of the software was doomed.",

At age 12, I scored a job working there too. During that time was when they announced their crispy chicken variant in Canada and &quot;new taste&quot; - but what we saw were new flour bags (we had to throw out the original flour bags), new oil in the cookers, new processes (no more soaking the chicken for 15 min before frying), and gravy that was made from a soup packet.<p>And while the chicken tasted the same, it was far more greasy and disgusting to handle compared to beforehand - and everyone noticed.  I remember our manager telling us &quot;Well I guess we now have to make it US style. But our prepared cost went from 11 cents per piece to 8 cents per piece after all bills are paid.&quot;",

Even if charges didn&#x27;t stick, you&#x27;d still have a bad time and be out thousands in legal feels.<p>What&#x27;s <i>actually</i> happened is de facto, not de jure, legalization (in effect, but not in law), because of the unpopularity of cannabis prohibition.

There&#x27;s so much to say..<p>Yeah, you can buy thc-a hemp legally in most places, as it&#x27;s federally legal, and few states restrict it specifically.<p>But.. just a couple notes to keep in mind:<p>This is indeed a grey area, even if it seems explicitly legal. Thc-a, through time, heat, oxygen, etc, WILL degrade into federal illegal THC. So if you buy a jar of thca hemp, the thca will turn into THC over time, and potentially rise above the legal limit of THC percentage.<p>This could mean, in the worse case scenario, that if they confiscate your legally purchased hemp, and test it, then they could charge you for illegal cannabis possession because it has more than the allowed thc, and therefore is not legal hemp.<p>Also, I&#x27;ve asked at hemp stores, and was told no.. But indeed, some growers spray thca liquid crystal and even non-cannabis derived terpenes on their bud. Pretty shady imo..<p>This market, although a legal victory, is actually a detriment to the industry and legalization as a whole, IMHO.",

        "text": "This was widely covered by the tech press back in April and was common knowledge among gaming enthusiasts much earlier. Intel has been working with motherboard suppliers to leave aggressive overclocking features turned on, and it&#x27;s also pretty clear they&#x27;re not correctly binning their chips. For a while now Intel hasn&#x27;t been &quot;innovating&quot;, just turning up the wick. They&#x27;re clearly lagging in R&amp;D while also trying to chase the very tippy-top of gaming benchmarks which makes no sense, even for world-class competitive FPS players.<p>Nvidia&#x27;s been flat out telling people complaining about games crashing on 13th and 14th gen CPUs to &#x27;talk to Intel&#x27;:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.techspot.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;102611-nvidia-advises-crash-prone-cpu-owners-look-intel.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.techspot.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;102611-nvidia-advises-crash-pr...</a><p>If you overlooked Ryzen because of issues like memory latency in the early days, I encourage looking at them again. If you do your homework, you can find motherboards that support ECC ram to varying degrees (ie from &quot;it&#x27;ll run but with ECC disabled&quot; to &quot;error correcting but doesn&#x27;t report it&quot; to &quot;full support, just not listed as such&quot;.) I believe AM4-socket ECC support is much more prevalent, if that&#x27;s important to you.<p>Familiarize yourself with AMD&#x27;s Precision Boost Overdrive, which can be used for overclocking <i>and&#x2F;or</i> undervolting. Unlike AMD&#x27;s graphics cards (which are space heaters, though the current 7xxx series is an improvement), Ryzen processors are fairly efficient in stock form; more so if you do even a bit of mild undervolting.<p>Don&#x27;t waste your time with the stock coolers supplied with any of the chips. They&#x27;ll keep the chip cool enough, but are noisy as hell compared to a well-performing $30 dual-fan air cooler (GamersNexus has found several in their reviews.)<p>Keep your BIOS up to date for AGESA (AMD microcode) improvements, and keep your AMD chipset drivers up to date as well.",

(And I&#x27;m sure that would be true even if the same instruments and same musicians are used.) Most of the differences come from different  conductors&#x2F;ensembles. (Orchestas also have &#x27;traditional performances&#x27; that they&#x27;d rather cling to, and may resist conductors (often younger ones) who attempt any &#x27;wild-haired&#x27; differences.)<p>Music&#x27;s very fluid. Recordings of performances are probably as close to &#x27;same&#x27; as we can get. Non-musicians may prefer to listen to these &#x27;same&#x27; performances over and over for the &#x27;fidelity&#x27; of their experiences. But it might stop them (as they age) from discovering better ones.<p>If MIDI is used to create the dynamics, &#x27;patches&#x27; and all other modulations, oscillations, tempos, et.al of a synth or ten, then something close to &#x27;same&#x27; might be approachable. But that means, oh, say, ten times as much work.<p>Depends on the listener whether that&#x27;s a good thing. In my experience, a superior cover of a single recording (same or different singer, different producer) can turn a OK single into a <i>damn!</i> single.<p>Edit:\n(Case in point: &#x27;Major Tom (Coming Home)&#x27; 1983 version: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=wO0A0XcWy88\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=wO0A0XcWy88</a> )",

There isn&#x27;t a lot of space between a node network and a modular synth patch.<p>The big difference is that you can save and load patches in a node editor, but you have to rebuild everything by hand on a modular. Even then you&#x27;re never going to reproduce panel settings exactly.<p>Some people find this appealing, but for me it&#x27;s the main reason I stopped using my big modular and changed to Cherry&#x2F;Softtube&#x2F;VCV Rack.<p>It&#x27;s also true that if you&#x27;re synth-literate you should be able to recreate many patches by ear. There isn&#x27;t usually that much going on, so it looks a lot more complex on paper than it really is. Things get more complex if you&#x27;re using modules that play samples or do something exceptionally unique, but even then you can usually get in the ballpark - if not exactly, then close enough for something that works aesthetically.<p>The <i>musical</i> part is a different problem. You can scribble graphic scores, but they&#x27;re far too crude to represent anything beyond the vaguest hint of what&#x27;s going on.",

Saving the patch state is one thing but actually notating is crazy. Like I can&#x27;t imagine someone being able to read this notation and play it accurately like someone sight reading a piano piece. You&#x27;d surely require familiarity with the setup ahead of time. As for recording it for posterity, being verbose and describing what you&#x27;re doing in full works, I guess.",

Second, how are hierarchical relations between concepts encoded? For example, how is the fact that &#x27;dog&#x27; is a kind of &#x27;mammal&#x27; encoded? We show how to extend the linear representation hypothesis to answer these questions. We find a remarkably simple structure: simple categorical concepts are represented as simplices, hierarchically related concepts are orthogonal in a sense we make precise, and (in consequence) complex concepts are represented as polytopes constructed from direct sums of simplices, reflecting the hierarchical structure.<p>Basically, LLM&#x27;s <i>already partially encode information as semantic graphs internally</i>.<p>With this it is less surprising that augmenting them with external knowledge graphs has a lower ROI.",

        "text": "I&#x27;m happy to see third-party comparisons, most of the marketing here indeed just assumes KGs are better with zero proof: marketers to be wary of. Unfortunately, I suspect a few key steps need to happen for this post to fairly reflect what the Microsoft NLP researchers called their alg, vs the broader family named by neo4j. Afaict, they&#x27;re talking about a different graph.<p>* The kg index should be text documents hierarchically summarized based on an extracted named-entity-relation graph. The blog version seems to instead do (document, word), not the KG, and afaict, skips the hierarchical NER community summarization. The blog post is doing what neo4j calls a lexical graph, not the novel KG summary index of the MSR paper.<p>* The data volume should go up. Think a corpus like 100k+ tweets or 100+ documents. You start to see challenges like redundant tweets that clog retrieval&#x2F;ranking, or many pieces of the puzzle spread over disparate chunks with indirect &#x27;multi-hop&#x27; reasoning. Something like a debate can fit into one ChatGPT call, with no RAG. It&#x27;s an interesting question how summarization preprocessing can still help small documents, but a more nuanced topic (and we have Thoughts on ;-))<p>* The tasks should reflect the challenges: multi-hop reasoning, wider summarization with fixed budget, etc. Retesting simple queries naive RAG already solves isn&#x27;t the point. The paper focused on a couple types, which is also why they route to 2 diff retrieval modes. Subtle, part of the challenge in bigger data is how many resources we give the retriever &amp;  reasoner, and part of why graph rag is exciting IMO.<p>Afaict the blogpost essentially did a lexical graph with chunk&#x2F;node embeddings, reran on a small document, and at that scale, asked simple q&#x27;s... So close to a naive retrieval, and unsurprisingly, got parity. It&#x27;s not too much more to improve so would encourage doing a bit more. Beyond the MSR paper, I would also experiment a bit more with retrieval strategies, eg, agentic layer on top, and include simple text search mixed in with reranking. And as validation before any of that, focus specifically on the queries expected to fail naive RAG and work in graph, and make sure those work.<p>Related: We are working on a variant of Graph RAG that solves some additional scale &amp; quality challenges in our data (investigations: threat intel reports, real-time social &amp; news, misinfo, ...), and may be open to an internship or contract role for the right person. One big focus area is ensuring AI quality &amp; AI scale as our version is more GPU&#x2F;AI-centric and used in serious situations by less technical users... A bit ironic given the article :)  LMK if interested, see my profile. We&#x27;ll need proof of capability for both engineering + AI challenges, and easier for us to teach the latter than the former.",

Old switching stations would take up entire buildings, when by the 80s and 90s it could be reduced to a single rack or less. The microwave tower system had requirements to have multiple backup generators available in case of power loss, and had to be built to withstand a blast (some distance away).<p>And of course bell labs created a number of incredibly important technologies. This isn&#x27;t as easy as just throwing money at the wall, someone had to be in charge of talent selection and what projects to invest in, but when you review what they were able to accomplish, it can really make you wonder what other labs were&#x2F;are doing.<p>&gt;Between 1960 and 1973, NASA spent almost $26 billion on the Apollo Program ($311 billion in 2024 dollars), over 2% of U.S. GDP.

    "title": "Show HN: Dropbase AI \u2013 A Prompt-Based Python Web App Builder",
    "url": "https://github.com/DropbaseHQ/dropbase",
    "text": "Hey HN,<p>Dropbase is an AI-based Python web app builder.<p>To build this, we had to make significant changes from our original launch: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=38534920\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=38534920</a>. Now, any web app can be entirely defined using just two files: `properties.json` for the UI and `main.py` for the backend logic, which makes it significantly easier for GPT to work with.<p>In the latest version, developers can use natural language prompts to build apps. But instead of generating a black-box app or promising an AI software engineer we just generate simple Python code that is easily interpreted by our internal web framework. This allows developers to:<p>(1) See and understand the generated app code. We regenerate the `main.py` file and highlight changes in a diff viewer, allowing developers to understand what exactly was changed.<p>(2) Edit the app code: Developers can correct any errors, occasional hallucinations, or edit code to handle specific use cases. Once they like the code, they can commit changes and immediately preview the app.<p>Incidentally, if you\u2019ve tried Anthropic\u2019s Artifacts to create \u201capps\u201d, our experience will feel familiar. Dropbase AI is like Claude Artifacts, but for fully functional apps: you can connect to your database, make external API calls, and deploy to servers.<p>Our goal is to create a universal, prompt-based app builder that\u2019s highly customizable. Code should always be accessible and developers should be in control. We believe most apps will be built or prototyped this way, and we&#x27;re taking the first steps towards that goal.<p>A fun fact is that model improvements were critical here: we could not achieve the consistent results we needed with any LLM prior to GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet. In the future, we\u2019ll allow users to modify the code to call their local GPT&#x2F;LLM deployment via Ollama, rather than relying on OpenAI or Anthropic calls.<p>If you\u2019re building admin panels, database editors, back-office tools, billing&#x2F;customer dashboards, and internal dev tools that can fetch data and trigger actions across any database, internal&#x2F;external service or API, please give Dropbase a shot!<p>We&#x27;re excited to get your thoughts and questions!<p>Demos:<p>- Here\u2019s a demo video: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;RaxHOjhy3hY\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;RaxHOjhy3hY</a><p>- We also introduced Charts (beta) in this version based on suggestions from cjohnson318 in our previous HN post: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;YWtdD7THTxE\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;YWtdD7THTxE</a><p>Useful links:<p>- Repo here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;DropbaseHQ&#x2F;dropbase\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;DropbaseHQ&#x2F;dropbase</a>.

I used to record wikipedia&#x27;s articles in audio format to help those who had trouble reading, so I&#x27;m a huge fan of anything that makes public domain work more accessible.<p>As a rabid audiobook consumer, I do have a couple of suggestions.<p>An easy one - currently you only use the Onyx voice from OpenAI. I&#x27;d recommend that at the very least you match the gender of the voice to the gender of the author. I find this is pretty common with published audiobooks, and I find it helps bring out the tone of the author more.<p>A harder one - most great audiobook narrators change their voice depending on the character speaking. If you really wanted to go in depth here, parsing the text by character and matching them to a voice would go a long way in making these more listenable. It would be fairly straightforward (albeit more expensive) to parse these books with an LLM and ask it to add inline markdown for the right voice options for each speaking character.",

I happened to have finished this a few weeks ago and it goes on my list of all &quot;engineers should read this&quot;.<p>This was really one of the most fascinating books I&#x27;ve read and likely the most definitive treatment of the subject by a subject matter expert.  I kind of skimmed the blog article, the book explains in critical detail the issues with the original design and why the re-design (done after the disaster) was a much more robust approach.<p>In a nutshell the Shuttle SRB field-joint design was taken from a Titan missle design that was deemed to be &quot;solid engineering&quot; because none had blown up, but Allan mentions the SRB field-joint was flawed from the start and the joints suffered rotation and physically moved &#x2F; flexed.  (Later, it turns out a Titan missle exploded and the teardown showed the o-rings a primary point of failure).<p>Allan mentions it was the blowby past the o-rings that was consistently the issue and the engineers wanted to understand and address this problem for a long time.<p>What was striking to me, beyond the technical aspects of making these things work is the actual cover-up and attempt on NASA+Thyokol to blame McDonald and others for the resulting disaster.  I knew of some parts of this, but you don&#x27;t realize how messed up the situation was&#x2F;is until you read the book.<p>Personally I&#x27;d ignore any negative reviews of the book, I think non-engineers, especially those who haven&#x27;t worked in an Aerospace&#x2F;Defense environment or in a big company might think Allan is arrogant or boasting, but he starts by providing the foundation for his statements before getting into the details which is a classic &quot;engineer&#x27;s engineer&quot; way of thinking.<p>* <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodreads.com&#x2F;author&#x2F;show&#x2F;2101296.Allan_J_McDonald\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodreads.com&#x2F;author&#x2F;show&#x2F;2101296.Allan_J_McDona...</a>",

But to avoid a pressurization test NASA went with a two-o-ring scheme where the space between them is pressurized, which forces the inner o-ring to be on the wrong side of where it should be, thus leaving little or no air buffer between that o-ring and the hot gasses.  That in turn can cause point failures in the inner o-ring which will result in concentrated jets of hot gasses impinging on the outer o-ring which then cannot hold (because the pressure isn&#x27;t uniform across the o-ring&#x27;s circumference, instead it&#x27;s concentrated on a point).  Add the cold o-ring brittleness and boom.<p>Is SLS still using this o-ring design??  I sure hope not.",

It covers quite a lot of territory, but the title is about mentally &#x27;Undoing&#x27; disasters.<p>Generally speaking, people pick a proximate human action or inaction as the keystone for preventing the problem.<p>In the book, they give the example of going back in time to kill Hitler - but people often don&#x27;t decide to go back in time to buy Adolf&#x27;s art - and then one of them suggests that even something as small as another sperm or no sperm &#x27;winning&#x27; that particular race would disrupt history just as well.<p>It is much more <i>satisfying</i> to think about killing Hitler than it is to think about throwing a rock at his parent&#x27;s window.<p>---<p>It is much more satisfying to think about NASA administrators taking the warnings seriously than it is to think about all the ways the culture and incentives were messed up. You can see a particular decision that was WRONG.<p>Finding fault with a person is a shortcut to mental satisfaction, but it will only at best fix one problem, and at worst will find the person who &#x27;rolled the dice&#x27; wrong, or who picked the wrong lottery numbers. That is, you can find a person who was standing next to the cause of the problem, but any other person in that same spot would have the same odds of causing the same problem.<p>---<p>I&#x27;ve also been thinking about learning organizations - any org that wants to accomplish really big things has to be able to learn.<p>I&#x27;d love to hear of any personal experience of contracts that allow for learning. I think it&#x27;s possible, but usually discouraged because contracts are written defensively, and learning involves a great deal of trust.<p>Its very clear in this case that NASA culture was deeply cynical and brittle. As a government organization they felt they could not show any failure or waste, and this must certainly have wormed into their group and personal psychology.<p>In contrast, SpaceX has demonstrated what a learning organization looks like - it looks like public failure. I emphasize IT LOOKS LIKE public failure. Learning means not being embarrassed about test rockets blowing up spectacularly. It means that you collect your data and improve, and try again.<p>To be sure, this would not work as well (or at all?) with a publicly traded company, and it certainly would not work with a government organization.",

There was a repeated pattern of near misses on the SRB&#x27;s over the years before Challenger, and most engineers working on the SRB&#x27;s felt very strongly that they should not launch.  The previous coldest launch was 15+ degrees warmer than Challenger&#x27;s, and came very very close to failure itself.<p>(And while it ended up not being what killed them, Rockwell, the folks who build the Shuttle itself, <i>also</i> did not want to launch, out of concerns about ice).",

We had a good exchange, but didn&#x27;t get to work together. (I was burned out from my job and wanted to go back to university to study computer science, and felt that accepting &quot;yet another job&quot; wouldn&#x27;t give me the perspective and foundational knowledge I was looking for. So I proposed a ridiculous rate that they understandably declined.)<p>However, we kept in touch over the years and I had good memories from our conversations.<p>During my studies, I fell in love with Rust. When I finished my bachelor&#x27;s degree in 2020, I was looking for jobs in Rust that were specifically not in the blockchain&#x2F;crypto currency industry (disqualifying at least 90% of the postings I had seen). Then Vector[3] caught my eye \u2013 a project by Timber.io. So I reached out to Zach again, and even though I had been fairly inexperienced in Rust, they took a shot on me. Eventually, Timber.io got bought by Datadog in 2021, and I sticked around until the end of 2022. After that, I was fully focused on finishing my master&#x27;s degree.<p>To close the circle, I ended up founding a new company with Zach at the beginning of this year. We&#x27;re still in stealth, but working on open source real-time video communication. If you&#x27;re interested in tackling hard challenges in infrastructure&#x2F;networking&#x2F;native UI with Rust, please feel free to reach out \u2013 we have some open positions and I would love to reach for the same community that has once so openly accepted me.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=12830763\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=12830763</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zach.sh\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zach.sh</a><p>[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vector.dev\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vector.dev</a>",

These jobs were abused as early customer feedback and I didn&#x27;t believe what happened there. I was basically braindumped.<p>The interviews from the startup matchmaking site were also kind of ridiculous. More bullshit consultants there than actual founders or actual developers that could or want to be building anything. These consultants want to hire you as a cheap developer, not as a founder, and definitely not as a shareholder. Happened so many times that I am not using this site for anything startup related anymore.<p>In general I&#x27;d argue that HN has a huge vetting problem, and by vetting I mean whether or not the intent of the people attending there come with honest intentions as to both their experience (which pretty much is almost always totally made up if you discuss more technical problems) and the idea of putting a lot of work into a problem to solve it (a _lot_ of people think that having a startup gig on the weekend, but only afternoons, leads to anything successful).<p>Most people come with so high expectations that it feels like being inside a ponzi community. Startups are a percentage game of luck, and you can only get an advantage if you have the right team at the right time, which implies that teams have to be absurdly motivated by a problem.<p>The people I found on this site are the opposite of that.

As the latter makes clear, this type of fraud is most likely done by <i>journal editors</i> (or their assistants), not by the authors:<p>&gt; When registering a new publication and its references at Crossref, a publisher may sneak extra undue references in the metadata sent in addition to the ones originally present. Then, digital libraries (e.g., SpringerLink) and bibliometric platforms (e.g., Dimensions) harvest these metadata, undue citations included. These sneaked references are processed and counted even if they are not present in the original publication.<p>The three journals in this particular case are all published by <i>Technoscience Academy</i>, an OA publisher operating out of India (not one of the well-known ones). I would think twice as an author before I submitted to any journal from this publisher, lest my paper is abused for manipulations like this (although I&#x27;m not sure if it has any journals worth submitting to anyway).<p>NB (because I got confused first): This is not really about Hindawi. Hindawi published the (trash) article that these fake citations were pumping up, but the pumping-up happened using Technoscience Academy journals.",

        "text": "Every time Haidt comes up, I do go through the post and do another literature search on social media effects.<p>The most notable thing about this post is the MHQ figures. However, you might note that the difference in age of smartphone use moves a person by at most one bucket. Given that he is suggesting a ban on smartphones and&#x2F;or social media, I would expect some more catastrophic effect.<p>In terms of the literature review, this time I read through [0]. It also finds small but significant effects on anxiety and depression, but finds no significant effects on overall measures of well-being. This is because social media also seems to have some positive effects on some other measures of well-being. This meta analysis also finds that age does not seem to change the effects of social media. On longitudinal studies, it seems like social well-being does decrease social media use, but anxiety and depression to not increase social media use. Also, social media use doesn&#x27;t seem to cause anxiety and depression here, so there is probably some third factor causing anxiety, depression, and social media use which causes this correlation.<p>Also interesting is that internationally the effects are neutral, and in the US, the effects are neutral, but in Europe they are negative, while in Asia they are positive. IDK why, but it doesn&#x27;t really support his hypothesis that social media has some sort of catastrophic impact worth banning.<p>[0]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gwern.net&#x2F;doc&#x2F;sociology&#x2F;technology&#x2F;2022-hancock.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gwern.net&#x2F;doc&#x2F;sociology&#x2F;technology&#x2F;2022-hancock.pdf</a>",

        "text": "This works until it doesn\u2019t. I have seen many startups raise a ton of cash from pre-payments, burn it on marketing and R&amp;D, and then find that the cashflow isn\u2019t forthcoming as expected. I force my companies to clearly show prepaid revenue on their balance sheet and treat it as debt. Any discounts provided to win the pre-payment also have to be recorded as a financing cost - not a \u201csales discount\u201d or buried in lower ARR. It might be borrowed from your customers, but it\u2019s still debt and you have to \u201cservice\u201d it by providing products and services that do have a marginal cost. Showing the financing cost achieves two things:<p>1. It allows you to run a higher EBITDA metrics because financing costs are backed out of EBITDA.<p>2. You record the non-discounted revenue for the customer, which is a truer representation of where the business could be one day when it\u2019s no longer playing the pre-payment game to generate cashflow.<p>Generally speaking, it\u2019s a good idea to generate cash from pre-payments, but don\u2019t treat it as free no-risk money. You can get over your skis quickly, run out of cash, and then be in a world of hurt when you\u2019re unable to service those customers.",

In reality they haven&#x27;t gained anything because <i>every</i> house is $800k and you still need somewhere to live so you still only own one housing unit of wealth.<p>Worse, people actively lobby for policies that increase  housing prices.<p>But if this house is worth $600k more where is that money coming from? It&#x27;s coming from the next generation who has to pay substantially more for the same house. It&#x27;s a wealth transfer from the young to the old.<p>How does this relate to third places? Well, imagine a neighbourhood cafe. 20 years ago that cafe space might cost $200k and have a commercial rent yield of, say, 5% so it would cost $10k&#x2F;year in rent for argument&#x27;s sake. Well, all property has gone up in value so that cafe&#x27;s space is now valued at $800k. It still demands a 5% yield so that&#x27;s now $40k&#x2F;year. All the cafe&#x27;s customers have to pay for that with increased prices.<p>So with increases in housing costs, people have less money to spend and that money doesn&#x27;t go as far. At a certain point, volume goes down and the business has to either close or raise prices, further exacerbating the problem.<p>Rising housing costs are strangling every aspect of society.",

The quality of the product is barely a step above a gas station.<p>On the other hand, my area has a few excellent locally owned options that are so important to me.

On that note, the srcset and loading attributes of img are very useful too, srcset as an alternative to &lt;picture&gt;, ostencibly aimed at use cases where the different sources are identical aside from pixel density (vs &lt;picture&gt; which is meant to contain potentially more significantly different images for different responsive layouts.)<p>I wonder which things I missed.

I am merely complaining about the chosen tag name and how much longer the much-later-added tag we all are supposed to use is than the tag which is in some sense--not technically, but morally--deprecated, as it undermines being able to use HTML as a true markup rather than a rendering target. If you find yourself thinking I&#x27;m against using &lt;strong&gt; and are somehow pro-&lt;b&gt;, maybe re-read the comment or go read some of my other much-longer explanations I&#x27;ve been &lt;strong&gt;-armed ;P into providing down-thread. FWIW, I do at least see how my comment was a bit confusing.)<p>Doing this reminded me how angry I am that I am supposed to use &quot;&lt;strong&gt;...&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&quot; instead of &quot;&lt;b&gt;...&lt;&#x2F;b&gt;&quot;. The verbosity overhead in a normal document of markup littered with five-character tags for something as basic as a keyword is sufficiently worse than one-character tags that it drives me to want to use something like Markdown (but then I am angered that it went with *...* and **...** instead of &#x2F;...&#x2F; and *...* and I just start to give up on other peoples&#x27; tooling entirely).",

And teams that share my preferences can use it a la carte without losing the rock solid foundation of GitHub.<p>I know it\u2019s not great that we\u2019re all locked into this platform that is owned by a megacorp that hasn\u2019t always been friendly, but it\u2019s at least a great platform.",

Someone at github decided to not render off-screen content. That breaks expectations compared to how it worked before, and that is why it feels like the app is going downhill.<p>The bigger point being that if anyone is doing a re-write, and trying to match the existing UX... that needs to be a deeper match than just getting the pixels in the right place.",

    "text": "Hey guys!  We just published our little open source project on GitHub and would love to get some feedback. It&#x27;s a very early release (alpha) but we thought it would be better to do it earlier so that we could get direct feedback.<p>Over the last 10 years we have built small to large web-projects of all kind. Almost every project involved managing images and files in one way or another. How do we manage our images and where? What happens if an image or logo changes, does it get updated across all sites? Which Host&#x2F;CDN to choose? Is everything we do GDPR-compliant?  With Daminik, we are trying to build a simple solution to solve these problems. One DAM with an integrated CDN. That\u2019s it.<p>You can check it out at:\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;daminik.com&#x2F;?ref=hackernews\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;daminik.com&#x2F;?ref=hackernews</a> (hackernews being the invitation code)<p>Repo:\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;daminikhq&#x2F;daminik\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;daminikhq&#x2F;daminik</a><p>We would love to get your guys feedback on our alpha.",

That is not how these teams work. They are not engineers. They are managers, designers, marketing people, etc. The entire point of a DAM is to turn garbage into gold. If you can\u2019t accept that, you won\u2019t succeed.<p>One sliver of DAM is rasterizing ALL non-raster files for thumbnail preview. Seriously, all files. Yes, people want thumbnail previews of PowerPoint files, and they better look good, too.<p>It gets so complex that an entire product exists for just this (amongst other things): <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.blitline.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.blitline.com</a> Yeah yeah \u201cit\u2019s just imagemagick as a service\u201d but go try running that yourself, for every type of file, warts and all.<p>Sometimes a file won\u2019t have an extension, or have the wrong extension entirely. Sometimes a file won\u2019t have metadata. Sometimes the CDN you are downloading a file from will not support range requests, or return 200 but with an error in the body, instead of the file bytes. You will never have checksums given to you to validate downloaded file integrity.<p>It will get complicated and messy. This is ONE OF the hard problems you are solving so that others don\u2019t have to\u2014 your value proposition.<p>Anyway, good luck!",

        "text": "Weirdly I know about this category of software from a prior life working at a major CMS company.<p>So, &quot;digital asset managers&quot; (DAMs) are basically fancy versions of the WordPress media library:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wordpress.org&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;article&#x2F;media-library-screen&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wordpress.org&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;article&#x2F;media-library-sc...</a><p>Why might a fancy version be needed? Well, the basic media library bundled with WordPress just uploads files directly into a web server directory, and then serves them from your web server using its static HTTP serving configuration (e.g. typically via Apache HTTP Server). The uploads are simple and 1:1, whatever you upload through the browser ends up on the web server as a file.<p>But usually, a media library could &quot;do more&quot; with those assets -- it could resize them, convert them to web-optimized assets (e.g. WebP), could create thumbnails and crops for different page layouts, could serve the content from a CDN. And that&#x27;s just images, but there are other things you could do for PDFs (create a searchable index), MSOffice files (auto-convert to PDFs), or videos (extract thumbnails, re-encode in other resolutions, serve from video CDN or hosted video player service, like Wistia or Vimeo).<p>Of course, if you don&#x27;t use WordPress, perhaps your CMS doesn&#x27;t have a media library function at all, in which case a DAM might be even more helpful. This seems to be the case for a number of static site generators (SSGs), for example.<p>On a quick glance, it looks like Daminik is going after this with a separate open source project (written in PHP), and for its alpha is focusing on image management (using ImageMagick under the hood for image conversions). It also seems like it has built in support for uploading assets to Amazon S3, which would mean presumably you could very easily put the AWS CloudFront CDN on top.<p>(I run a personal WordPress site, and the way I personally handle this is to live with the built-in WP media library, but then put Cloudflare caching and CDN atop at the edge.)",

It may be cheap and easy to implement reporting features which will get you adoption.

If you are reporting on who&#x27;s using old assets, assets are reused inappropriately, who needs to be contacted to replace something etc. it will be much easier to get adoption.

Reading your description here left me even more confused, so we store images like logos and when we update it here then everything else updates because it&#x27;s pulling the image from a CDN that Daminik provides? How often does something like that actually work? If a logo changes I&#x27;d need to resize&#x2F;design it for 4-5 different sizes&#x2F;color schemes minimum. Even just an image changing means I probably need a @2x&#x2F;@3x size as well, there is never &quot;one image to rule them all&quot;.<p>I assume this isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;d ever have a use for based on what I understand about it so far but it might just not be well explained.",

        "text": "I have been looking at this domain for a while now and thinking about how one might become a &quot;Social Entrepreneur&quot; in this domain. As an example, India has now included all senior citizens over 70 under its Universal Health Coverage umbrella (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nha.gov.in&#x2F;PM-JAY\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nha.gov.in&#x2F;PM-JAY</a>) and hence the need for these services&#x2F;organizations have become more pressing. In developed countries with a large aging population the situation is even more dire.<p>The main issues i can think of are;<p>1) Regulations - Govt. mandated laws on access to health records, personal liability etc.<p>2) Insurance - Can these services be charged under govt.&#x2F;private insurance schemes&#x2F;claims?<p>3) Personnel Training - All employees must be trained in aspects of Nursing and People management, there must be on-call Doctors etc.<p>4) Wellness Centers - Places where the elderly can be brought in for regular companionship and prophylactic exercises.<p>5) Transport - A fleet of vehicles to transport the elderly to and from their homes.<p>6) Supplies - Medicines and everything else as needed.<p>There are three main models that i can think of;<p>a) The &quot;standard&quot; elder care homes which take care of everything for a fee.<p>b) A live-in nurse&#x2F;maid&#x2F;caretaker employed through a agency (popular in developing countries) where the person lives with the family taking care of the elder. You pay a monthly fee to the agency and they pay the caretaker&#x27;s salary after taking their cut.<p>c) A on-demand comprehensive health services company. This can be a non-profit&#x2F;for-profit organization offering various services (medical&#x2F;support&#x2F;companionship etc.) to the elderly who live alone or have nobody to look after them. Services could be offered based on the needs and on a yearly&#x2F;monthly contracts or as needed per call. Think of it as Uber&#x2F;Wework for Healthcare. I think this is the need of the hour since there is a huge population above 50 worldwide living alone. Just helping them maintain their health will go a long way towards easing the pressure on the healthcare system leaving the hospitals free to serve those who need it most.<p>To drive the point home, watch this 3-part documentary series on &quot;Living and Dying Alone in Singapore&quot; to get an idea of what awaits many senior citizens - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=d499mlwXWfk\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=d499mlwXWfk</a><p>The organization mentioned in the above documentary and from which we can learn is here - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chenghongwelfare.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chenghongwelfare.org</a>",

        "text": "<i>&gt; While composites might seem like a futuristic technology, in many ways, they hark back to millions of years of human and even pre-human material technology. Wood, after all, is the original composite material, as it\u2019s composed of long and short fibers glued together by other substances\u2014much like modern synthetic composites are often made up of carbon fiber held together by epoxy resins. Wood was a chief enabler of the success of our species, and it exhibits many of the advantages and disadvantages of composites.</i><p>Not to nitpick too much, but while wood is &quot;technically&quot; a composite material made up of fiber embedded in lignin, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s very useful to include it under the broad category of composite materials. Engineered woods like plywood and cross-laminated timber definitely are, but it&#x27;s more useful to classify regular wood as an organic raw material rather than a composite.<p>The first composite material humans had any experience with was probably silcrete. It&#x27;s naturally occurring but ancient humans figured out how to strengthen it by heat treating it in a fire (80-160 kYa). The first time humans intentionally made a composite material is adobe&#x2F;mudbrick (11 kYa), wattle and daub (6 kYa), plywood in Mesopotamia (5.4 kYa), cob (4 kYa), and finally Romans developed something resembling concrete (I dont remember kYa).",

It required real-world measurement, experiment, and modeling in silico using biophysical models. Those are all hard research efforts. And it seems like the mindset now is: we&#x27;ve done enough hard research, let&#x27;s feed what we know into a model, hope we&#x27;ve chosen the right hyperparameters, and see what we get. Hidden in the weights and biases of the model will be that deeper map of the real world that we have not yet fully grasped through research.<p>But the AI cannot provide a &#x27;why&#x27;. Its network of weights and biases are as unintelligible to us as the underlying scientific principles of the real world we gave up trying to understand along the way. When AI produces a result that is surprising, we still have to validate it in the real world, and work backwards through the hard research to understand why we are surprised.<p>If AI is just a tool for a shotgun approach to discovery, that may be fine. However, I fear it is sucking a lot of air out of the room from the classical approaches. When &#x27;AI&#x27; produces incorrect, misleading, or underwhelming results? Well, throw more GPUs at it; more tokens; more joules; more parameters. We have blind faith it&#x27;ll work itself out.<p>But because the AI can never provide a guarantee of correctness, it is only useful to those with the infrastructure to carry out those real-world validations on its output, so it&#x27;s not really going to create a paradigm shift. It can provide only a marginal improvement at the top of the funnel for existing discovery pipelines. And because AI is very expensive and getting more so, there&#x27;s a pretty hard cap on how valuable it would be to a drugmaker.<p>I know I&#x27;m not the only one worried about a bubble here.",

I asked him how did he know it was correct? He said &quot;just look at it. The digits are right!&quot;<p>We were limited in the use of the campus PDP-10 by a CPU time allotment per semester. He was planning to blow his allotment computing pi, he figured he could compute it to 15,000 digits or so. At the end of the term, he fired it up to run overnight.<p>The PDP-10 crashed sometime in the early morning, and his allotment was used up and had no results! He just laughed and gave up the quest.<p>Later on, Caltech lifted the limits on PDP-10 usage. Which was a good thing, because Empire consumed a lot of CPU resources :-&#x2F;",

He did a phenomenal job writing the parser and laying the groundwork for an interpreter. One of the beautiful things right now about this project is its simplicity \u2014 it\u2019s tiny compared to cel-go for example. I\u2019m also a huge fan of our Axum-style functions[1] where you can register pretty much any closure as a custom function to be used in your CEL expressions. There\u2019s still some mileage to go to support some of the more obscure aspects of the spec, but I feel like we\u2019re getting close, and we have an excellent little cadre  of contributors that have been extremely helpful in moving this forward.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;clarkmcc&#x2F;cel-rust&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;example&#x2F;src&#x2F;functions.rs\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;clarkmcc&#x2F;cel-rust&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;example&#x2F;src...</a>",

Clearly the Vision Pro is not that device.<p>I&#x27;m pretty confident Meta has the same issue. They pushed using Quest for meetings, for productivity, and now their new commercials are pushing it for better instruction. But, I&#x27;m pretty confident, none of their employees use it for those purposes and if they don&#x27;t, why would anyone else?<p>The Quest at least as a bunch of games, some of which are worth the experience I know several of their employees that play those games so that&#x27;s the one thing they are actually using the device for themselves.",

You still have a long road to get better tech into a lower price range.<p>Then somebody proposes that you sell 100,000 of what you have right now for $3500. This provides $100 million dollars of profit to offset your research costs. In the end, you manufacture 80,000 and sell 60,000 of them. So you net $10 million plus 60,000 free testers (well, 1000 after everyone stops using them at all) plus 20,000 surplus units to use in various research.<p>Gizmodo can paint this as a commercial failure. Apple could sell the 20,000 unsold units for $100 each. That would generate another $2 million of profit even at a $2400 marginal loss per unit. They would fly off the shelves and Gizmodo would paint this as a huge commercial success. Even though Apple still wouldn&#x27;t hit their 100,000 unit target. It would create panic in Apple&#x27;s competitors even though they actually make a profit on $500 headsets.<p>So read this however you want. It&#x27;s a commercial failure because it only netted $10 million dollars and might only net $1 million&#x2F;year going forward. Or it&#x27;s a successful funding round on the road to cheaper and more capable future products.<p>I&#x27;m not particularly an Apple fan, but I think it&#x27;s silly to portray this in such a bad light. Would somebody like SimulaVR love to experience such a &quot;failure&quot;?<p>(All numbers above except the 100,000 target units and the $3500 price are hypothetical.)",

I need to have my task windows not be co-planer.<p>2) Last time I checked up on this, practically no one [2] is working on this, I have stopped even watching the VR space.  The hardware is here, but no one is making the software I want.<p>3) Vision Pro (as I understand it) is not a productivity VR headset.  It&#x27;s an ipad on your face that can remote into your desktop - but not in a way that integrates into the 3d window manager.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;varjo.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;aero&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;varjo.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;aero&#x2F;</a><p>[2]: Okay, techincally SimulaVR is working on a native 3d window manager, but they opened preorders years ago and still don&#x27;t have a ship date.",

Do Xata and the other examples of this all deploy into all the cloud providers and all the regions and let you choose which one?

That the Best Seller list is a gamified black box is basically an open secret. The NYTBR, in particular, has become far too interconnected into the MFA-publishing-literature industrial complex. The reviews are so bland and milquetoasty <i>because</i> so much MFA-lit is bland as all hell and the reviews are just marketing.<p>The NYRB and the LRB are orders of magnitude better reading than the NYTBR, even if this article seems to criticize them (unfoundedly, in my opinion) as fuddy or old fashioned. They&#x27;re not traditional &quot;reviews&quot; in the sense that they usually don&#x27;t come around to saying whether a book is good or bad, though; they&#x27;re essays that use the books reviewed as launch vehicles for pushing the ideas in them into new directions or put under a new light. The NYTBR, in contrast, often reads as ad copy or toothless summary (the latter being the plague that has infected nearly all film criticism as well).<p>There has also been a big resurgence in smaller mags, like N+1 (now an elder statesmen of the new upstarts), The Drift, The European Review of Books (heavy focus on translation), and many others that have excellent, lively, criticism. Also subreddits like r&#x2F;truelit are a great way to expose yourself to new or interesting books. I usually find a book to add to my TBR list once or twice a week. Is the writing always up to par with professional publications? Not always, but sometimes it honestly is. (r&#x2F;truelit does have a strong slant towards formal experimentation, though, which some people aren&#x27;t a fan of. People more interested in &quot;the classics&quot; or contemporary-lit can find great recs still in r&#x2F;literature.)",

But in practice they seldom seem to understand that this is, or should be, their function, and either they do nothing at all or they do more harm than good.

        "text": "Good article, gives a enjoyably written dressing down of the NYT&#x27;s culture of elitism.<p>&gt; Give me an opinion, damn it! Now! Or I drop you!<p>I mean that&#x27;s the core of it, right? You&#x27;re looking for an opinionated review in a place where the writers are tasked with being objective, what you called &quot;8th grade summary&quot; style. I understand the desire and would prefer it myself, but a shift to opinionated reviews changes the game. The tastes of the reviewer are now front and center and whether or not you find the review valuable is dependent on how similar they are to your own. It&#x27;s hard to build a long-lasting brand when the tone becomes intertwined with the individual.<p>&gt; The dawn of the internet did not bring about a democratization of book reviews for the better\u2014let us look again at Goodreads as an example of what can happen and then, quickly, look away. We still need critics to review publications that bring in intellectual and other histories while making judgments about books but without fetishizing books or authors.<p>In many ways I <i>thoroughly</i> enjoyed this section. It&#x27;s truly a blessing to watch an author undermine their entire argument so completely all at once. In a way I suppose it&#x27;s a compliment, Mr. Nair is so talented at arguing for a position that in a moment of distraction took a wrong turn into the contra and simply kept moving forward without skipping a beat. To build up such a strong foundation and then knock it down like a sandcastle is, if nothing else, entertaining. You&#x27;re there on the eve of battle inspired to charge in and destroy the ivory tower and evils that precipitated it only to find out the plan is to build a new one, but paint it eggshell this time. And it&#x27;s not as if eggshell isn&#x27;t an improvement, ivory is after all stilted and antiquated but-- perhaps we could make the new thing not quite as tall?",

And reading it took me back when I was lucky enough to take Richard Rorty&#x27;s class (entitled something like Philosopy from Kant to 1900) my freshman year at Princeton. I remember the impact of his lectures about James and pragmaticism - I was a bit of a smart alek - convinced that there was only one right way of looking at the world and I (of course! :) knew what it was. James&#x27; Pragmatism and his concept of the cash value of ideas - the idea that you could ask how thinking and believing about the world in some particular way might be valuable to someone (in particular) as a part of measuring its &quot;objective&quot; value (it was a long time ago and I may be not giving a fully accurate report here of what James&#x2F;Rorty actually said) had a big impact on me.<p>Rorty left the Philosophy department (for Virginia, I think) pretty soon after that class - due to the kind of disagreement between the analytical philosophers and him rumored to be at the root of the Bernstein&#x2F;Yale break (Rorty didn&#x27;t believe that logic was the core of philosophy).<p>And Rorty was a gifted lecturer with an extremely dry sense of humor. I think I laughed more often in that class than in any other that was to follow.",

From that he could figure out the length of the instrument, and the curve of the side. All this with nothing more than a compass and a straight edge. He claimed it was the more historical way to do it, as they did in the 1600&#x27;s. His instruments were well regarded by musicians today, and fetched a good price.",

Here&#x27;s my attempt to summarize the key points.<p>An MIT-educated neurosurgeon quit his job after realizing surgeries weren\u2019t addressing the root cause of patients\u2019 problems. He observed that the outcome of surgeries would vary greatly: for some it would help, for others a bit and for others, it would not help at all even though he performed them perfectly every time. Some patients even called before the surgery to say that they were okay and no longer needed surgery.<p>So he started asking patients questions and after 9 years he concluded that patients who got better and healed did the following (at 19:42 in the video): low salt diet; mostly plant-based diet; did things that would cause sweat: exercise, sauna, or living in hot weather; did not smoke; drank little to no alcohol; had good social support: family, friends, etc; slept 8 hours a day; were not stressed or managed to release it back, e.g. meditate.<p>Then he talks about the moral dilemma. If he helps patients to truly heal by sharing what he has learned, he and the hospital would not make money.",

Even if you are rich and get treated like a king, you still have to question whether your doctor&#x2F;surgeon is trying to sell you a procedure.

        "text": "For senior developers who are ready to write code, integrating the appropriate AWS SDK library for your programming language and writing a few lines of code might seem straightforward, and may not take more than half a day. However, consider a large company with thousands of applications\u2014like in my case\u2014where this effort is multiplied a thousandfold. Moreover, these applications are developed in over 10 different languages, some of which may not even have an available AWS SDK. Therefore, using an agent that simplifies these operations into a single HTTP call to a sidecar service truly adds value.<p>Another consideration is operation; imagine that there are 10 different libraries maintained for this purpose, and if there is a new feature, say, you need all logs going to one place, making sure it is available in all languages would require a team with different programming skills to do so. Secrets agent, being language agnostic, you only need to change at one place, and someone else may have already done it for it or ready to do it, as it is open source project.<p>When it comes to cost saving, imagine scenarios where a junior developer improperly implements secret retrieval in a Lambda function, with retrieval occurring at every function invocation and each function handling 100 transactions per second. Such a single oversight can cost $1,000 a month, and if left unnoticed for a year\u2014a common occurrence when the function appears to work\u2014people often overlook further scrutiny as long as it functions.",

My definition of elegance is the achievement of a given functionality with a minimum of mechanism and a maximum of clarity.<p>Second, the value of metaphors should not be underestimated. Metaphors have the virtue that they have an expected behavior that is understood by all. Unnecessary communication and misunderstandings are reduced. Learning and education are quicker. In effect metaphors are a way of internalizing and abstracting concepts such that one&#x27;s thinking can be on a higher plane and low-level mistakes are avoided.<p>Third, use of constrained languages for design or synthesis is a powerful methodology. By not allowing a programmer or designer to express irrelevant ideas, the domain of possible errors becomes far more limited.<p>Fourth, one must try to anticipate both errors of human usage and of hardware failure and properly develop the necessary contingency paths. This process of playing &quot;what if&quot; is not as easy as it may sound since implicit is the need to attach likelihoods of occurrence to events and to address issues of the independence of failures.<p>Fifth, it should be assumed in the design of a system, that it will have to be repaired or modified. The overall effect will be a much more robust system, where there is a high degree of functional modularity and structure, and repairs can be made easily.<p>Sixth, and lastly, on a large project, one of the best investments that can be made is the cross-education of the team so that nearly everyone knows more than he or she needs to know. Clearly with educational redundancy, the team is more resilient to unexpected tragedies or departures. But in addition, the increased awareness of team members can help catch global or systemic mistakes early. It really is a case of &quot;more heads are better than one.&quot;</i>",

Maybe even obfuscate them with some encoding. Do whatever you can to make it really hard for anyone to accidentally rely on an unverified address. Ideally make it impossible for anyone except the team in charge of authentication to even see an unverified address.<p>On another note, holy shit.

        "text": "Here are some useful graphs showing how electricty demand varies by region, month and time of day [1].<p>As expected, California peaks in July because there&#x27;s more demand for cooling than heating. But what&#x27;s a little surprising is that July is peak demand for <i>every</i> region.<p>There are many reasons why solar is so attractive as a power source, including:<p>1. It&#x27;s the only form of power with direct electricty generation. There&#x27;s no heating water to turn a turbine;<p>2. Solar basically has no moving parts. You can point panels towards the Sun to increase efficiency but the panel itself and transmission has no moving parts;<p>3. Solar panels continue to massively reduce in price and increase in efficiency and it&#x27;s not clear where this ends;<p>4. Obviously solar generates its pwower when the Sun is shining. This conincides with when most power is usedk. Adding solar to the power generation mix reduces the peak load required to generate from other sources;<p>5. Solar installations can be really small, including on individual houses, reducing the transmission capacity required for last-mile and regional power transport.<p>Batteries are just one method to store excess power for variable (renewable) energy sources. Another is carbon sequestration to create fuel directly, called Carbon Capture and Storage (&quot;CCS&quot;) [2]. This isn&#x27;t economic yet. But it may have applications in, say, cold climates where battery performance noticeably degrades.<p>Solar power is the future.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eia.gov&#x2F;todayinenergy&#x2F;detail.php?id=42915\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eia.gov&#x2F;todayinenergy&#x2F;detail.php?id=42915</a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iisd.org&#x2F;articles&#x2F;deep-dive&#x2F;why-carbon-capture-storage-cost-remains-high\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iisd.org&#x2F;articles&#x2F;deep-dive&#x2F;why-carbon-capture-s...</a>",

Boy, was I wrong - the game not only portrays the setting perfectly, the necessary creative liberties it takes to engage the player are &quot;worth it&quot; and I can only imagine S. Lem would have agreed to them(well, other than one of the endings....but it can&#x27;t be perfect I guess).<p>I&#x27;d write a lot about what I enjoyed, but nearly all of it would be spoilers.

It must have been costly. I learned a lesson, but I also internalized some guilt about it.<p>Reflecting on this, I was in an environment where it was the norm to edit production live, imagining we could be careful enough. I&#x27;m suggesting that the error the author publicly took the fall for was not all their fault. Everyone up the chain was responsible for creating that risky situation.

I was brought in to pick up on the maintenance and development of the B2B order placement web service the previous developer had written.<p>Sadly, the previous dev designed the DB schema and software under the assumption that there would only ever be one business customer. When that ceased to be the case, he decided to simply create another database and spin up another process.<p>So here I am on my first day, tasked with creating a new empty database to bring on another customer. I used the Microsoft SQL Server admin GUI to generate the DDL from one of the existing tables, created (and switched the connection to) a pristine, new DB, and ran the script.<p>Little did I know, in the middle of many thousands of lines of SQL, the script switched the connection back to the DB from which the DDL was generated, and then proceeds to drop every single table.<p>Oops.<p>Of course, the last dev disabled back ups a couple months before I joined. My one saving grace was that the dev had some strange fixation on logging every single thing that happened in a bunch of XML log files; I managed to quickly write some code to rebuild the state of the DB from those log files.<p>I was (and am) grateful to my boss for trusting my ability to resolve the problem I had created, and placing as much value as he did in my ownership of the problem.<p>That was about 16 years ago. One of the best working experiences in my career, and a time of rapid technical growth for myself. I would have missed out on a lot if that had been handled differently.",

        "text": "Last time this discussion came up, someone shared this nice article[0] about all the different ID options. It mentions Stripe IDs, which have pretty prefixes like &quot;prod_foo&quot; and &quot;user_bar&quot;. These are great for users of their API (no wondering what an ID refers to) and for internal tooling and debugging, but have to be stored as inefficient varchars, which is not great for indexing and whatnot.<p>So I spent the weekend creating &quot;UPID&quot;[1], which is like ULID but prefixable! Up to four characters for the prefix, 40 bits of time (256ms precision, but could change in a revision) and still 64 bits of randomness. So you can do pretty Stripe-style IDs without losing the benefits of a neat 128-bit UUID column. Have implemented it for Python, Rust and Postgres, maybe worth a kick around for someone!<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;brandur.org&#x2F;nanoglyphs&#x2F;026-ids\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;brandur.org&#x2F;nanoglyphs&#x2F;026-ids</a><p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;carderne&#x2F;upid\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;carderne&#x2F;upid</a>",

PSNR is equivalent or better, and the rendered output can be denoised with, say OptiX.<p>Some downsides&#x2F;caveats \u2014 it works best if you retrain a little, so you won\u2019t get the best quality if you\u2019re pulling over mipnerf trained Gaussians, it\u2019s slower to render than a straight rasterizer, like 50% slower, and of course these splats still don\u2019t have geometry to them, as is much discussed elsewhere.<p>They spent a lot of work optimizing doing this for Nvidia\u2019s RTX series, and the raytracing task is a little different than the typical one, which is to say it\u2019s rare in \u2018normal\u2019 raytracing that you\u2019re adding up the colors of 100s of transmissive, semi-transparent colors&#x2F;radiances to get a single pixel; usually the bulk of the color from a raytraced scene comes from a smaller number of rays. If this method becomes popular, then NVIDIA could no doubt optimize the raytracing architectures further in the future and you\u2019d get back some of that speed.<p>All this to say, I hope this gets rolled into existing engines, it\u2019s practical engineering that would add a lot of options to workflows, and pretty neat!",

The way that VS hides all the &quot;complexity&quot; behind layers and layers of menu&#x27;s is god awful. I dont want to learn how to speed click through a GUI, I want to learn whats happening on a lower level.",

My writing group meets remotely because (a) covid and (2) one of the members moved to Ohio from Chicago. We manage not to have the issues about people interrupting etc., likely because we (a) care about what we\u2019re doing and (2) actually that caring about what we\u2019re doing really covers it. We do have structure in that we\u2019re workshopping 2\u20133 stories per session and we have a four-part agenda for each story (aboutness, likes, suggestions, questions). Everybody has done the necessary homework before the meeting (in this case read the stories and written up their notes), but the structure means that we avoid a common workshop trap of everybody just reading their notes to the group and since you know your notes will go to the writer, you don\u2019t need to feel obligated to say everything you\u2019ve written down.<p>Thinking about this, I can see pretty clearly how this could be translated into work meetings pretty easily and fits with a lot of the other commentary here.<p>But bottom line, either the meetings will suck or they won\u2019t and what matters is not whether they\u2019re in-person or remote but how they\u2019re run.",

Many meetings, especially daily standups, do not prioritize and filter out user stories and tasks causing them to take way too long. People zone out making the meetings less effective. It&#x27;s basically weaponized on some projects especially when the management doesn&#x27;t have a clue what&#x27;s going on. It enables the blame game e.g. &quot;well why didn&#x27;t you say something during the meeting?&quot;<p>It&#x27;s usually pretty clear what should be discussed, but it&#x27;s rare to see a project manager who looks at the activity stream on Jira or equivalent. There&#x27;s usually a huge disconnect between management and dev teams in general, even on a relatively &quot;well run&quot; project where everything goes as planned with minimal friction. Devs wind up picking up a lot of slack and just have their own informal meetings amongst themselves to remedy it.<p>This is terrible long term. Every project I&#x27;ve ever been on inevitably hits a snag and all this unravels into management going into freak out mode when they realize how big these communication gaps have become.",

Instead of a presentation, write about 5-6 six pages of prose and hand them out at the beginning of the meeting. Every one will scan the document in their own ways and write up questions. After 20 minutes or so, start discussing the document. This way, the presenter doesn&#x27;t have to drone on about things that everyone knows, and one can focus on real questions.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.edwardtufte.com&#x2F;files&#x2F;Consume_Produce_14_15.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.edwardtufte.com&#x2F;files&#x2F;Consume_Produce_14_15.pdf</a>",

        "text": "Better meeting skills in person help make remote meetings better.<p>Lots of great tips in the comments, for me it&#x27;s making sure meetings don&#x27;t become a timepass.<p>Meeting cadence whtn the meetings are new is important.  Often eaiser to have a regular meeting and a mini check in the frist while until things are going.<p>Ongoing Cadence is important, too often or too little time to get things done can be hindrance.<p>Days of week can make a difference too. Talk Tuesday morning and Thursday afternoon to leave time for people to start dealing with their week, and also on Thursdays to have enough time to finish something for Friday.<p>The later in the week a meeting is, the less that can be done about it that week and it can perpetually push into the next week.<p>Group note taking and agenda - there are neat meeting management apps out there that make things more interactive like carrying forward agenda items automatically, sending out the agenda for you in advance, etc.<p>Note taking - This has become easier with AI, but having someone still send them out is great.  Depending on whether management wants, having an out line of people&#x27;s tasks documented to them can make it easier, but everyone should be taking notes to not get dependent on this.  If this can be available often meetings can be shorter.<p>Agendas and concise materials before meeting- can help people catch up and prepare to help make sure the meeting is about decisions and discussions in support of a discussion, and not discussion for the sake of doing the work on the meeting itself.<p>Juniors first - one for the best things Ive ever seen is having juniors offer their input and thoughts first, which can be followed up outside the meeting with ongoing mentorship with seniors.  it can be as simple as this is what I have learned to understand about this, and the rest of the team learns that they can rely on this person more.<p>From a tech side, something novel and fresh every so often can help.  Learn to use Zoom&#x2F;Teams&#x2F;Mmmhmm and it keeps it visually interesting and easy to pass around updates.",

    "url": "https://github.com/amakelov/mandala",
    "text": "`mandala` is a framework I wrote to automate tracking ML experiments for my research. It differs from other experiment tracking tools by making persistence, query and versioning logic a generic part of the programming language itself, as opposed to an external logging tool you must learn and adapt to. The goal is to be able to write expressive computational code without thinking about persistence (like in an interactive session), and still have the full benefits of a versioned, queriable storage afterwards.<p>Surprisingly, it turns out that this vision can pretty much be achieved with two generic tools:<p>1. a memoization+versioning decorator, `@op`, which tracks inputs, outputs, code and runtime dependencies (other functions called, or global variables accessed) every time a function is called. Essentially, this makes function calls replace logging: if you want something saved, you write a function that returns it. Using (a lot of) hashing, `@op` ensures that the same version of the function is never executed twice on the same inputs.<p>Importantly, the decorator encourages&#x2F;enforces composition. Before a call, `@op` functions wrap their inputs in special objects, `Ref`s, and return `Ref`s in turn. Furthermore, data structures can be made transparent to `@op`s, so that an `@op` can be called on a list of outputs of other `@op`s, or on an element of the output of another `@op`. This creates an expressive &quot;web&quot; of `@op` calls over time.<p>2. a data structure, `ComputationFrame`, can automatically organize any such web of `@op` calls into a high-level view, by grouping calls with a similar role into &quot;operations&quot;, and their inputs&#x2F;outputs into &quot;variables&quot;. It can detect &quot;imperative&quot; patterns - like feedback loops, branching&#x2F;merging, and grouping multiple results in a single object - and surface them in the graph.<p>`ComputationFrame`s are a &quot;synthesis&quot; of computation graphs and relational databases, and can be automatically &quot;exported&quot; as dataframes, where columns are variables and operations in the graph, and rows contain values and calls for (possibly partial) executions of the graph. The upshot is that you can query the relationships between any variables in a project in one line, even in the presence of very heterogeneous patterns in the graph.<p>I&#x27;m very excited about this project - which is still in an alpha version being actively developed - and especially about the `ComputationFrame` data structure. I&#x27;d love to hear the feedback of the HN community.<p>Colab quickstart: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;colab.research.google.com&#x2F;github&#x2F;amakelov&#x2F;mandala&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;docs_source&#x2F;tutorials&#x2F;01_hello.ipynb\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;colab.research.google.com&#x2F;github&#x2F;amakelov&#x2F;mandala&#x2F;bl...</a><p>Blog post introducing `ComputationFrame`s (can be opened in Colab too): <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;amakelov.github.io&#x2F;mandala&#x2F;blog&#x2F;01_cf&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;amakelov.github.io&#x2F;mandala&#x2F;blog&#x2F;01_cf&#x2F;</a><p>Docs: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;amakelov.github.io&#x2F;mandala&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;amakelov.github.io&#x2F;mandala&#x2F;</a>",

I&#x27;m very interested in how you think about incremental computation - I find cache invalidation to be incredibly annoying and time-consuming when running experiments.<p>We wrote our own version of this (I think many or all quant firms do, I know such a thing existed at $prev_job) but we use type annotation inspection to make things efficient (I had ~1-2 days to write it, so had to keep the design simple as well). It&#x27;s a contract: if you write the type annotation, we can store it. Socially this incentivizes all the complex code to becoming typed. We generally work with timeseries data, which makes some things easier and some things harder, and the output format is largely storable in parquet format (we handle objects, but inefficiently).<p>One interesting subproblem that is relevant to us is the idea of &quot;computable now&quot;, which adds a kind of third variant from the usual None&#x2F;Some (i.e. is something intrinsically missing, or is it just not knowable yet?). For example, if you call total_airline_flights(20240901), that should (a) return something like an NA, and (b) not cache that value, since we will presumably be able to compute it on 20240902. But if total_airline_flights(20240101) returns NA, we might want to cache that, so we don&#x27;t pay the cost again.<p>We sidestep this problem in our own implementation (time constraints) but I think the version at $prevjob had a better solution to this to avoid wasting compute.<p>(side note: hey Alex! I took 125 under you at Harvard; very neat that you&#x27;re working on this now)",

I\u2019d like to speed up iteration time and intelligent caching would help.<p>These libraries are pretty opinionated, which make it a bit challenging to imagine how to squeeze cache decorators in there. They have a couple different APIs, all of which ultimately use the Open CASCADE (OCCT) kernel via <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;CadQuery&#x2F;OCP\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;CadQuery&#x2F;OCP</a><p>CadQuery is a Fluent programming design that relies on long Method Chains [0]. It also has an experimental Free Function API [1].<p>Build123d iterates on CadQuery [2] with the goal of integrating better with the Python programming language. It has two supported APIs. The Builder API uses Python\u2019s context manager (\u2018with\u2019 blocks) heavily. The secondary Algebraic API is more functional, using arithmetic operators to define geometric operations [3].<p>The simplest way to integrate Mandala would probably be to use Build123d\u2019s Algebraic API, wrapping subassemblies in functions decorated with @op.<p>However, it would be even better to proactively cache function&#x2F;argument pairs provided by the underlying APIs. For example, if I change 50% of the edges passed to a Fillet() call, it would be nice to have it complete in half the time. I guess this would require me to fork the underlying library and integrate Mandala at that level.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cadquery.readthedocs.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;intro.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cadquery.readthedocs.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;intro.html</a><p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cadquery.readthedocs.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;free-func.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cadquery.readthedocs.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;free-func.html</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;build123d.readthedocs.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;introduction.html#advantages-over-cadquery\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;build123d.readthedocs.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;introduction.html...</a><p>[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;build123d.readthedocs.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;key_concepts_algebra.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;build123d.readthedocs.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;key_concepts_alge...</a>",

There&#x27;s 100 different ways to skin the dependency problem: Nix, pipenv, nvm, rustup, etc. There&#x27;s no telling which a contributor prefers to use, so .envrc doesn&#x27;t belong in git IMHO.

I gave it a good go, had it running on my main project from February to May.<p>In case you hadn&#x27;t realised, the very concept of having two sets of binary distributions on one machine, vying for superiority and the correct version of glibc...  is fraught.<p>Most of my use was with rails projects, and I can&#x27;t recommend it.<p>Coupled with an abstraction that tries to save you from Nix, but almost entirely fails, you end up with a bloated hellscape where every time you load your project it will unnecessarily reinstall your packages and several times an hour it will have forgotten curl exists and so you have to manually reinstall curl (not-so-slowly increasing your &#x2F;nix folder&#x27;s size), every week or two a new version of devbox completely changes the workarounds you need to do, and don&#x27;t try to garbage collect nix or it will delete vital files, and you end up scrubbing it all and starting again.<p>In python, it overrode the path so I couldn&#x27;t get it to reliably use the binaries in the venv. Pip and Python were using packages in different places and I couldn&#x27;t get them to converge for love nor money.<p>The devbox team were great and really tried to get things working, but in the end I couldn&#x27;t get it to work with enough stability to properly recommend it to my team, and if I wanted it to half-work for any substantial length of time I had to lock to a version of devbox.<p>Obviously, ymmv, please do give it a try, it&#x27;s an impressive project. But my view is that it&#x27;s trying to do something that is very very hard, and for that you need a very clever solution. And this is a very clever solution, with very clever bugs, and so it&#x27;s not something I&#x27;d recommend jumping into with both feet.",

        "text": "The article was clearly written by an enthusiast, but is a bit muddled. I see nothing in what he has written that supports the idea that Color Wheels are wrong.<p>Color wheels are, in essence, highly abstracted slices across the equator of a color space. Only two color wheels are commonly used: the RGB and the RYB (aka the artists color wheel). Color from pigments and color from light are two wildly different things, but easy to confuse. For its absence of green as a primary, CMYK can be understood as a version of RYB. Black is used not just because it is cheap but also to add opacity to the inks (printing inks are more like dyes... very thin and transparent).<p>The color opposites the author describes are red&#x2F;cyan in RGB and red&#x2F;green in RYB.<p>One property of these opposites is that they mix to neutral. For this, the RBG pair works best. The other property is that they are perceptually antagonistic, for which the RYB pair works best.<p>Interestingly, the perceptually antagonistic pair set (red&#x2F;green, yellow&#x2F;purple, blue&#x2F;orange) were spoken about well before Newton placed these colors in a circle. Leonardo Da Vinco refers to them as &#x27;retto contrario&#x27;, literally exactly opposite.<p>The author asks &#x27;why a wheel&#x27;? which is a good question, and the answer he gives is reasonable. But... Newton was the first to employ this device, and he did so almost certainly because the harmony structure of the musical scale was commonly visualized as a wheel, and Newton was keen to draw an analogy between music and color and harmony and the music of the spheres and god etc etc. He may have been the first physicist, but he was also an alchemist.<p>Color is a frustrating beast... so many different ways to understand the same thing: perception, physics, aesthetics, chemistry etc. Truly the seven blind men and the elephant.",

(Cadmium red, cobalt blue, burnt sienna, etc)  A print artist or someone designing figurines or design objects would think in terms of pantone colours. Someone doing thread painting with embroidery floss will think about DMC colour codes.<p>And then of course there are colourist working on movie and TV productions who would know all the article describes and more.

It&#x27;s a model, after all, and models don&#x27;t have to be true as long as they&#x27;re useful. The RYB color wheel is definitely not useful for setting colors in CSS, but as far as I know, the story goes something like this:<p>Before today&#x27;s industrial processes, the colors of paint you could make or buy were those one could make from natural ingredients, for example cobalt for blue if I remember correctly. Artists and their suppliers noticed that if you had red, yellow and blue paint, all of which one could make from the materials available, then you could mix them to make any color you wanted (possibly with some white or black added to lighten&#x2F;darken, or tint&#x2F;shade if you&#x27;re being pedantic). Further, you could make a lot of colors by mixing at most two of these colors, and it was purely the proportions of the mix that mattered, not the raw amounts.<p>So these got called &quot;primary&quot; colors, and it was natural to represent them in some way - to the engineer, a triangle seems like an obvious choice where the mix with 25% red and 75% blue lies 0.25 along the line from red to blue. Artists chose a circle instead, which is really the same model (mathematicians would say it&#x27;s a topologically continous deformation from one to the other). At the time, the color wheel model turned out to be useful, and so it stuck around and got taught in art schools.<p>Magenta, Cyan and Yellow would have done just as well as starting points, but were harder if not impossible to get from the natural materials used at the time.<p>On the other hand, orange or brown as a starting color would not have got you the same mixing abilities as far as I&#x27;m aware. Brown is an interesting data point on its own because you can make it by taking orange and shading with a small amount of black, but you can also make it by taking orange and adding some blue (among many other ways), so now you&#x27;re using all three primaries and fall off the color wheel. And that&#x27;s before we talk about perceptual brightness and gamma correction and all that.<p>Red, Green and Blue on the other hand is a useful starting point for things that emit rather than absorb light (with similar but different caveats).",

        "text": "As an artist I have a perspective on color from a pragmatic (as opposed to theoretical) point of view. Visual artists use materials like paints or inks applied to substrates. These all are exploiting subtractive color, primaries are complements of additive color, CMY vs. RGB.<p>The standard color wheel interleaves CMY with RGB, which sets up useful symmetries and complementary relationships. But of course, the color wheel is really a color cylinder, or set of cylinders when color properties other than hue are considered. Color saturation and value are crucial to artistic work, but when these additional dimensions are accounted for it&#x27;s no longer the simple model the basic color wheel portrays.<p>Color classification systems emerged in the 20th century and over time evolved into the highly rigorous regimes codified by the International Color Consortium. Everybody is familiar with ICC profiles and their uses. I can&#x27;t say I have a thorough understanding of them, I&#x27;d guess relatively few people do.<p>Artists don&#x27;t have handy ICC profiles to guide creating a painting or print. They learn how to mix colors mainly by trial and error. However the paints and inks are precisely formulated by manufacturers who very much understand the science of color. This precision results in  product constancy which makes life far easier for artists. With experience they gain an intuitive &quot;fix&quot; on particular colors and their locations on the extended color wheel.<p>To make it even more convoluted there are metallics, gold, silver, copper, etc. and the range of man-made iridescent and interference pigments. These &quot;colors&quot; aren&#x27;t easy to merge with even multidimensional color &quot;wheels&quot; (or matrices). Nonetheless, people typically interpret these pigments as colors.<p>A subtle factor is opaque vs. transparent color effects. These aren&#x27;t mutually exclusive, but in &quot;pure&quot; form are distinct. Opaque colors may be mixed to form an intermediate color, but at lower saturation and value. More than not this is how people are taught to manipulate colors often in accordance with the basic color wheel.<p>Transparent colors may be mixed like opaques, with somewhat similar results. However, <i>layering</i> transparent colors potentially produces extended effects. While both opaque mixing and layered color are subtractive, layering can combine in several ways producing multiple &quot;virtual&quot; colors modified by filtering effects of layers.<p>Any color wheel, or multidimensional matrix, is unlikely to accommodate the numerous ways colors combine or mix, or non-color colors. Artists use color wheels or more complex structures to gain pragmatic info about the colors they&#x27;re using and predict results of manipulations. In any case, most real-world paints, inks, etc., don&#x27;t behave like pure colors. A color wheel is only valuable as a pragmatically useful tool.",

        "text": "Once we can model the inner workings of the eyes, and optics of the physical world on &quot;small&quot; scale, accurately enough, it will be possible to collect lots of data on data. Consequently, an analysis of whether two invididuals of same skin color, medical profile (e.g. no cataplexy) and proportionally similar facial and body anatomy, that have near identical eyes, see colors differently in a laboratory environment. How can we make them to see colors differently by only making optical changes to the environment? Will we discover that species, age, sex or some mutation affects their &quot;sensitivity&quot; so that for some factors slight change can make colors seen differently?<p>The pattern: Control experimentally (IE slightly opposed to &quot;statistically&quot; where done afterwards) for the confluencing factors that seem obvious but you are uncertain are complete (IE can you &quot;find &#x2F; make two test-subjects significantly more identical with a reasonable amount of effort?&quot;); choose something that can be observed in laboratory setting by the invididuals such that you can replicate the same environment for both of them; and now study this changing this thing the invididuals supposedly observe similarly at least in this and that environment by only changing the observed thing; seems to be more general, EG applicable to taste, smell. This may also actually not provide that much new scientific information.<p>What is the best neuroimaging definition for color that can be made? IE, a program that gives a probability of what seeing colors differently causes in the brain. I think we should, because our intuition is to teach children that animals also see colors at least partially, have the program be such that it is reasonably species agnostic. Surely the patterns one will need are out there...<p>Yet, it turns out to be more likely that we will end up with different definitions for all bugs and all big land animals or something similar. Then we would want to turn that into two different vocabularies. But we realize that how MUCH DOES EVERYTHING MAKE SENSE once we go that route and what we can see will no longer be what defines how we speak. The Urdu decided to base their vocabulary primary on this and that qualia research and the Latinists have developed a thousand times larger dictionary from the fact they prefer to highlight small taxonomical details even when the effect is small, and are now proposing based on neurological twin study of the differences between these two groups a new addition to the Esperanto language for describing how the musical experiences of speakers of both languages differ. Sixteen years later Urdu and Latin both have developed many new layers on top of their descriptions of the Esperanto research.<p>What new artifical languages will qualia research give birth to?<p>Will homoiconic programming languages have an application in cybernetics EG the program modifying it&#x27;s internal structure based on how an implant detects your definitions and other patterns in thinking to change? And actually, what is the cybernetics of this: when a person given implant that reads and writes into their consciousness &quot;need&quot; to explicitly communicate that &quot;No, I want THIS thing, THAT is my expression self, not what you the implant will read&quot; to prevent &quot;bad&quot; loops?<p>Will these sorts of languages converge?<p>The language that &quot;universally&quot; describe &quot;baseline&quot; human experience are a sort of exit condition that prevents an endless recursive complexity from drowning us. I believe that for the sake of sanity once we have the cybernetics to ascend this should be kept as separate language aside the new languages that might araise, which could be launched from dead languages. This will probably occur naturally because the group that does not have cybernetics will retain their tongue; but imagine getting ripped of your cybernetics and due to your lack of knowledge of the baseline language being in a state of linguistic disability.<p>DNA modification may lead to the baselanguage rupturing, EG the babies who as I wrote this on 2024-07-12 were inside their mothers might have few who have been modified to gain a vision that also expands their gamut, or least alters it. This one could argue will not be a problem because we have always had color blind humans: but color blindless has always be a problem; and DNA guaranteeing perfect eyesight at cost of altered \nbut not disable color perspection is NOT a maldaptive mutatition.<p>There is another safe anchor, more powerful than retaining baseline language, called computability theory. For the moment, no sapient creature on earth has even approached this, but eventually computational limits will force different languages arising from hopefully endless storms of the conscious experiencs to converge. If the irony that the AI zombie problem exists in philosophical literature is put aside, eventually with (if) multiple SAIs are sitting around Tellus and Milky Way talking to each other and modelling what is happening in the other&#x27;s brain, they might reach a state where the rational action is to start unifying many languages speaking of the same topic instead of languages of qualia on top of each other. It might as well be that they are all versions of the same successful blueprint for being a SAI and there is not much difference in their &quot;minds&quot; because any would be an inefficiency.<p>Half of this is meaningless, but only because I had several things to express and don&#x27;t stress about being wrong.",

In the US there is a fairly straightforward process to sue someone in small claims court without a lawyer and with fairly small fees. But small claims courts are limited to small awards.<p>I have not worked as a freelance programmer nor hired any, but a friend really likes to hire freelancers for various projects and often asks me for advice and tells me about his travails. I think practically speaking, it is not that hard for a freelancer to get paid because software always needs upkeep for bugfixes or updates to work with other software or to add new features. And it is far far far more expensive to have a second freelancer look at the first freelancers code and do the updates.<p>Some people say it takes more time to read code than to write it. I am not sure if that is true but very often if you ask a second freelancer to do minor updates on another freelancers code, the second guy will just say that the code is so awful the whole thing has to be rewritten from scratch. So you have a big advantage just by having written the stuff and having the code in your head and written in your style. You are the best man to fix it and update it by far.<p>My friend always pays his bills but he is a very tough negotiator, and often gets comparatively good bargains for freelance work. However, all the benefits of his bargains disappear when he needs the software to be changed a bit in six months or so. Then the freelancer is in the drivers seat and my friend completely drops his tough negotiator stance and becomes super nice and friendly towards the freelancer.<p>So if you do not want to pay for lawyers and small claims court is not suitable for some reason, you may just send a demand letter saying that you are charging a 20% penalty for non-payment and interest will accrue in the future, and just wait for your client to need some update and then you demand that all previous invoices be satisfied before discussion for new work even begins.<p>IANAL, this is not legal advice. If the sum is a large amount, it would probably be best to consult a lawyer.",

This happened to me a few times.<p>First off, if possible, you want to stage your contract with multiple deliverable milestones, each associated with them giving you money. When they pay you, you move on to the next stage. It&#x27;s more upfront work, and more oversight, and just generally more complicated than &quot;I work for a couple of months and then throw the whole thing over the fence, and you throw me a bag of money from the other side&quot;. But, the upside for you is less risk and a steadier source of income.<p>For the client, it builds in more opportunities for feedback, including the opportunity to say &quot;I don&#x27;t want to work with this guy anymore,&quot; or &quot;actually, I&#x27;m running out of money and I want to pump the breaks&quot;, so it reduces their risk as well.<p>I never took anyone to court; I guess I got lucky.<p>I recognize none of this has answered your question. The only real advice I have is that there&#x27;s got to be a reason they are refusing to pay. If they don&#x27;t have the money, unfortunately you are probably never going to get paid, even if you take them to court. If they do have money, and are just unsatisfied about something (not necessarily your fault, it&#x27;s often just a misunderstanding) then I would do everything in my power to figure out what is wrong and fix it. Word-of-mouth referrals are so important to contracting, and often just being really high-touch and communicative with the client\u2014and yeah, occasionally giving them a few hours of free work to indulge their petty whims\u2014can turn an angry client into a happy, paying customer.",

I&#x27;ve refunded part of this amount a handful of times if some part of the process doesn&#x27;t work out for whatever reason, so I don&#x27;t spend or invest the money until the project is done.<p>It&#x27;s not just that you&#x27;re losing less money if the client decides not to pay. It&#x27;s also that your clients are more likely to pay: a client who is willing to pay up front isn&#x27;t stingy with money. These clients are better in a lot of other ways, too.<p>I think in 5 years of doing this, I&#x27;ve been turned down by 2 clients because of this. I freelanced a year before I started having this policy, I was turned down by 1 client after giving an estimate.<p>Repeat clients, I don&#x27;t make them pay up front. I might reconsider that if a client was significantly late on a payment, but so far that hasn&#x27;t been a problem, possibly because the up-front pay half filters out clients likely to pay significantly late. I say &quot;significantly&quot; because I&#x27;ve on occasion waited as much as 2 weeks for payments, but in those cases I believe it was due to disorganization rather than any malicious intent.<p>EDIT: One thing that I think makes clients willing to pay half up front is that typically I try to break the project into as small of chunks as possible, with a truly minimal viable product being released up front. The first contract is for the first chunk, and the half up front is for that chunk. This results in a smaller initial payment, as a lot of my initial contracts are in the range of $4000-$8000.<p>This also incentivizes them to agree to breaking up projects--some clients want to sign one big contract for a $250k two year project, but balk at paying half of that up front--and when the project finishes faster and for far less than they initially wanted to sign for, I gently remind them how much money I saved them.<p>Additionally, a lot of the value I bring to the table is this sort of process improvement. I&#x27;ve been in contact with a few clients a few years after we worked together, and found out that they were still doing the small-releases process I brought in. I&#x27;m not going to call it agile because a lot of these companies were doing &quot;Agile&quot; before--that word basically doesn&#x27;t mean anything any more, unless you&#x27;re really clear about defining it as defined by the Agile Manifesto.",

        "text": "Others have addressed the process to get paid (legal, factoring, collections etc).\nAnd tinco&#x27;s comment (currently top) on disengaging emotionally is essential reading. I thought it might be useful to describe what some classes of non or late payer look like from the inside:<p>1)  We&#x27;re solvent, and promised you two week terms - but our accounting dept doesn&#x27;t work like that.<p>In this case, whoever signed the contract should have flagged that they can&#x27;t execute two-week terms. But sometimes their eyes have glazed over before they get to that bit of the contract - or they don&#x27;t know how their accounting dept works (often with a monthly payment run). In this case, the contractor is likely to eventually be paid. But getting paid on the actual terms would only happen if you have enough leverage to get an executive to force the accounting dept to make an exception, and do it every single time.<p>2) We&#x27;re solvent but have a cash flow problem.<p>Here, a company will push back payments until its cash flow problem is resolved. But that could be months, or even longer. They will make the most critical payments each months - for things that they rely on going forward, like their cloud provider, DNS etc. At this point the engineering team will learn (if they didn&#x27;t already) to make sure they get notifications of non-payment for critical services, rather than relying on accounting to be able to triage them. Your payment depends on having some kind of leverage - providing a critical service is best, but being the squeaky wheel can also work, as there may be <i>some</i> cash left after the critical ones. Being paid consistently, but always late, is another sign - this means the accounting dept has a hole, but it&#x27;s of fixed size and they&#x27;ve &#x27;solved&#x27; it by taking a float from all their creditors. In this case, you are likely to be paid - eventually.<p>3) We are about to go bust. This looks rather like 2, except that you won&#x27;t get consistently paid even late, and their other contractors are also likely to not be being paid. If the company is gambling for resurrection, they may even be more engaging on the actual work side, if they think your work is part of what will save their bacon. Legally, incurring debts if you <i>know</i> that you&#x27;re insolvent is fraud (at least in the UK). But, that hard to prove and only applies if there isn&#x27;t some chance of not going bust. I suspect that if there&#x27;s a big chance of going bust, there&#x27;s actually a propensity to spend more on contractors - since the chances are that they won&#x27;t need to pay. Sometimes a company structures itself so that it can make a subsidiary insolvent but keep going. This might be identifiable from filings, but I&#x27;m not an accountant so  I can&#x27;t advise how. Although, I&#x27;m not going to work again for a company where the CEO has made himself a creditor secured against the company IP....<p>Others that I don&#x27;t have any insight into, perhaps others can comment:<p>4) We are a big company and can get away with X month terms regardless of the contract<p>5) Shenanigans are our way of doing business. We think of it as &quot;playing hardball&quot;.",

So they came in sockets and many were very easily user-replaceable.<p>Other than that, the equipment was usually built to last for decades.  It would have been the stupidest thing in the world to get a new radio every 5 or 10 years when all it needed was a new tube or two.  And once you had a radio that was satisfying, most people never wanted to buy another radio again.  They most often went forward focused on additional types of long-term technology acquisitions, like TV sets and an automobiles with automatic transmission.<p>Semiconductors made almost all tube equipment obsolete as fast as the expanding variety of devices could be developed, so silicon booms are nothing new.  Corresponding bust cycles must also have been endured by semiconductor companies who have prospered over the decades.<p>The demand for semiconductors is real strong again, especially the more complex and innovative developments.<p>But as time goes by, the demand for the semiconductors needed to produce products having long-term value is not the demand causing the complaints about overwork.<p>It&#x27;s the extreme demand for <i>disposable</i> semiconductors, and the manufactured-for-landfill products that incorporate them, which has been gradually putting more pressure on fabrication workers in the same production facilities where it didn&#x27;t used to be this bad.",
